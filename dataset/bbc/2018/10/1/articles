            "content": "Apple has remained silent amid complaints that its new iPhone XS and XS Max smartphones fail to charge consistently when plugged in.\n\nSeveral users have reported that their device refuses to charge if it has been idle for a while. Some charge only if the display is \"woken up\".\n\nVideo blogger Lewis Hilsenteger dubbed the issue \"chargegate\" in a video demonstrating the problem.\n\nHowever, Apple has not yet commented on the issue.\n\nMr Hilsenteger presents the Unbox Therapy channel on YouTube, which has more than 12 million subscribers.\n\nIn a video published on Saturday, he tested nine iPhones by plugging them into an official Apple power supply.\n\nWhile the 2017 iPhone X charged without problem, many of the new XS and XS Max phones refused to charge when plugged in.\n\nMost of the phones would charge only when the display was activated to wake up the device. However, one of them would not charge at all.\n\nMr Hilsenteger said he had been alerted to the problem when a viewer had emailed him describing their troubles.\n\nHe had not noticed the issue himself because he used wireless charging rather than the power cable on his device.\n\n\"Responding to those people on a platform like this should bring light to it and hopefully some sort of software fix, if possible,\" he said in the video.\n\n\"This is my job. I have to call this stuff out. I have to hold these companies accountable.\"\n\nSeveral complaints about the XS and XS Max failing to charge have also been posted on Apple's discussion forum on its website.\n\nComplaints can also be found on social media, where some people have described being unable to charge their phone at all once the battery is exhausted.\n\nSome users have speculated that the problem is related to a recent change in Apple's security settings.\n\nSince iOS 11.4.1 was released, the lightning port on iPhones can be disabled when the phone has been idle for a while. That could stop thieves, cyber-attackers or law enforcement officers accessing it.\n\n\"In some cases, it might not charge,\" the company advises on its website.\n\nHowever, that does not explain why more iPhone XS and XS Max users are facing the issue.\n\nApple has not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment.",

            "description": "After the death of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, a light is shone on food allergen labelling.",
            "section": "England",
            "content": "The inquest into the death of a girl who suffered a fatal reaction to sesame in a Pret a Manger baguette has shone a light on food allergen labelling. As the hearing concludes, experts say lessons need to be learned from the teenager's death.\n\nFor people with food allergies, eating out can be a distressing experience.\n\nThere is the fear factor of leaving the allergen-free comfort zone of a person's own kitchen, and often a feeling of embarrassment; of not wanting to ask too many questions of waiting staff, or to call attention to one's dietary needs.\n\nTo combat those concerns, a new law aimed at making things easier for people with allergies to eat out safely was introduced in 2014.\n\nBut experts say it doesn't go far enough.\n\nUnder current guidelines, takeaways and restaurants are only required to let customers know if any of the 14 most dangerous allergens - including peanuts, eggs and milk - are ingredients in their food.\n\nHowever, freshly handmade, non pre-packaged food does not have to be individually labelled, according to the UK's Food Regulations 2014.\n\nThe Pret baguette Natasha Ednan-Laperouse bought falls into this grey area.\n\nThe 15-year-old, from Fulham, reacted to sesame in the sandwich she bought at Heathrow Airport in July 2016.\n\nCoroner Dr Sean Cummings recorded a narrative conclusion at West London Coroner's Court - finding that the teenager was \"reassured\" by the lack of specific allergen information on the packaging.\n\nHe said the labelling was \"inadequate\" and he would be writing to the government about reduced food labelling on products made in shops.\n\nLaw student Amelia Zekavica, 20, who said she had suffered an allergic reaction to sesame in a Pret sandwich in the past, said businesses should do more.\n\nShe said: \"The food industry needs to list all of the ingredients on the packaging. I think everything should be included.\n\n\"It's very serious. You shouldn't have to check and ask for an ingredients book or list, it should be labelled.\n\n\"The industry should understand that there are people out there who have allergies. People can die.\"\n\nWhat are the laws on allergens in food products?\n\u2022 Sesame is one of the 14 allergens that consumers must be made aware of when it is used as an ingredient in food products, according to EU Regulations\n\u2022 However, the EU rules say individual member states are responsible for deciding on how information about non pre-packaged food is provided to the customer\n\u2022 The UK's Food Regulations 2014 allow freshly handmade, non pre-packaged food to not be individually labelled\n\u2022 Pret confirmed at the time of Natasha's death products would not have been individually labelled with allergen or ingredient information, and that this was within regulations\n\u2022 However, Pret said there were signs in the fridge and at till points telling consumers with allergies to speak to a manager for advice or to see its allergen guide\n\n\"Labelling food is absolutely crucial, as in the severest form of allergies it can be the difference between life and death.\n\n\"Lessons have to be learned from this; we have the top 14 allergies for a reason and businesses should take responsibility for labelling.\"\n\nDavid Pickering, of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said the law was designed to \"reduce burdens on smaller businesses\" but suggested it may need to change.\n\n\"Big chains probably have a formulaic approach to making sandwiches, which is totally different to a local shop where they can make it up as they go along and it's potentially not as controlled,\" he said.\n\n\"[Businesses] can simply comply with the legislation - as Pret said they had in this case - but should also look to go further, to find better ways to communicate with people who have allergies.\n\n\"If businesses are complying and these situations still occur, then maybe the law needs to be looked at again.\"\n\nProviding a safe eating experience for allergy sufferers should be paramount, according to Holly Shaw from Allergy UK.\n\nShe said: \"Cases [like Natasha's] show that at the very severe end of the scale, lives can be lost if people come across something they're allergic to.\"\n\nData highlighted by the FSA, Allergy UK and the Anaphylaxis Campaign suggests children and young adults are \"disproportionately more prone to die from an allergic reaction than adults\".\n\nThe FSA has launched a new campaign - easy to ASK - to encourage young people to ask food businesses about allergens when eating out.\n\nIts chairman Heather Hancock said: \"Living with a food allergy or intolerance is not easy and can have fatal consequences.\n\n\"It's crucial that [young people] feel confident to speak up and ask for allergen information, and that the people around them make that easier.\"\n\nUltimately, there is an onus on both businesses and customers with allergies to take responsibility, according to Ms Shaw.\n\nShe said: \"We're at a place now where there's still work to be done, but allergy awareness is far more increased.\n\n\"Effective communication is really important for food business operators, who also need to make sure the [allergen] information they provide is accurate.\n\n\"It is important that allergen labelling is consistent.\n\n\"But people [with allergies] also have a responsibility to ask questions as well to make sure they are aware.\"",

            "section": "UK Politics",
            "content": "One of the things I never tire of saying here is that two things can be true at the same time.\n\nWell, it is true that the next few days in Birmingham matter a lot to the Tory party - and to whether the prime minister's vision of Brexit survives the next few weeks and its passage through Parliament in the Autumn.\n\nIt is also true that what happens in Birmingham is not where the crucial moving parts really are.\n\nDespite all the clamour and genuine unhappiness in parts of the Tory party about the Chequers compromise - the anger that it is a \"betrayal\" of the vote, along with more tepid frustration that if we end up in a half in/half out situation what was the point of it at all?\n\nIt is, cabinet ministers say privately, \"crazy\", \"unrealistic\", \"pointless\", to suggest that there is a real chance of changing her fundamental position right now.\n\nOf course, the precise shape of the Brexit deal is not yet set.\n\u2022 Theresa May: 'I do believe in Brexit'\n\u2022 Johnson refuses to rule out May challenge\n\nBut the view at the top of government is that it is simply too late for any kind of dramatic redrafting.\n\nRemember, after all, it took more than two years to get to this point of compromise.\n\nRemember too, that the EU is well aware that the PM is not going to shift, if she does indeed compromise further, until after this week.\n\nThat's one of the reasons why the unexpected rebuff at the Salzburg summit was such a surprise, after an unwritten deal had been done not to rock the boat until after the Tory conference.\n\nThe real action, the real drama will play out in the next three weeks between our negotiators and the senior actors in the UK government and Brussels and members of the EU.\n\nThere is a sense here that the big conversation is happening elsewhere.\n\nWhere of course the next few days do matter, is in setting the general mood and direction of the Tory party in the next few months.\n\nThat will of course have an impact on MPs who will have to make their decisions about an eventual deal in Parliament through this Autumn.\n\nMinisters joke that getting to a deal with Brussels might end up being the easy bit.\n\nWithout a majority, Number 10 can't be sure they will be able to get a deal through.\n\nThe government machine expects that they will probably have the numbers - that MPs ultimately with the choice of a deal, or potential chaos, will choose something that looks more stable.\n\nBut they can't guarantee that entirely. And MPs who might be swithering in the middle do, and will in the coming weeks, listen to the views of their party members.\n\nExpectations of the conference this week are low. Ministers are braced for a very bumpy week.\n\nBut the most critical conversations are yet to be had and may well not take place here at all.",

            "description": "European makers and shakers are hooked on the \"mad drama\" as it moves to Birmingham.",
            "section": "Europe",
            "content": "Never, before the UK's Brexit vote, had European makers and shakers taken such a keen interest in domestic British politics. Now, they're hooked.\n\n\"It's partly the mad drama of it all,\" one EU diplomat emphasised to me. \"I mean: who knew the British could be so volatile. What happened to the stiff upper lip?\"\n\nBut many other decision-makers in Europe have persistently pointed out to me the need to \"keep an eye\" on what UK politicians say about the Brexit process at home, in contrast to what they may agree or seem open to in Brussels.\n\nA famous example of this was former Brexit Secretary David Davis announcing to the UK back in December that a freshly agreed joint EU-UK Brexit report, signed off by Theresa May and the president of the European Commission, was actually nothing but a \"statement of intent\".\n\u2022 Theresa May: 'I do believe in Brexit'\n\u2022 Johnson refuses to rule out May challenge\n\nWhile this weekend, the former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, claimed that the UK's joint commitment with the EU to an Irish border backstop (basically: a fall-back position to avoid a hard border) was explained to him by the Prime Minister and her advisers as merely a \"form of words necessary to float the negotiations [with the EU] off the rocks\".\n\nWere those really Theresa May's thoughts on the backstop - which is a crucial point in the UK's exit agreement with the EU? Or did she choose to \"sell\" the backstop to her then foreign minister in that way in order to get him to sign up to her negotiations with Brussels?\n\nOr did Mr Johnson make the whole thing up to grab headlines, put the prime minister under even more pressure at home and throw another big spanner in the works of her negotiations with Brussels?\n\nWhatever the reality, European politicians' main takeaway is that the UK government has proved to be a somewhat unreliable partner in Brexit negotiations - also fond of posturing at home (a la \"Brussels can go whistle for its money\") and of catchy but rather empty slogans like \"Brexit means Brexit\", \"red, white and blue Brexit\" and \"Global Britain\".\n\nEuropean watchers of UK politics expect more of the same at this week's Conservative Party Conference.\n\nSo why the huge European interest?\n\nWell, it's not so much the details of the conference that mesmerise EU Brexit negotiators but rather what is hoped might follow straight after.\n\nThe accepted wisdom in Brussels is that Theresa May couldn't possibly afford to really negotiate with the EU (meaning give as well as take) in the weeks leading up to the Conservative Party Conference.\n\nTo have conceded anything more to Brussels, off the back of her Chequers Brexit plan which is much derided within her own party, could have finished her off politically.\n\nSo, the Brussels logic goes, the UK Prime Minister will put on a big show of strength for domestic consumption during her party conference - tough on EU migration, tough on foreigners purchasing UK houses, tough on Brussels\u2026 in order to buy herself enough breathing space at home after the conference to finish off negotiations in Brussels.\n\nAnd where are we with that - with so little negotiating time left?\n\nWell, despite the uproar in the UK following the recent EU leaders' summit in Salzburg, nothing of Brexit negotiations' substance actually changed there.\n\nWhat was true of negotiations before the summit:\n\u2022 that both sides had advanced massively as regards the UK's exit treaty but that the Irish border remained the key sticking point\n\u2022 that the EU welcomed some points in the Prime Minister's Chequers Brexit proposal, such as her suggestions on future EU-UK security relations, but rejected others, on Ireland and on future EU-UK economic relations\n\nremained the case afterwards too.\n\nThe EU insists it will never back away from its commitment to member country Ireland and to the communities both sides of the Irish border to get a legally binding commitment from the UK that no hard border will appear between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThis is in order to safeguard the Northern Ireland peace process.\n\nMany European voices tell me they believe that UK negotiators see the Irish border issue as an economic one that can be solved with give and take on both sides, rather than a social, historical issue with the potential for a resumption of violence.\n\nIn fact, many in the UK now see the Irish border issue as a constitutional one. The idea that Northern Ireland would follow EU customs rules and regulatory standards, separate from the rest of the UK, after Brexit is seen by some - including the prime minister - as unacceptable.\n\nSo can this circle be squared after the Conservative Party Conference?\n\nMy EU sources are quietly confident. They point to the potential, written into the Belfast agreement, for more devolution from the rest of the UK.\n\nBut there is a distinct possibility that the tone could instead harden further on both sides. Meaning no deal.\n\nOr, just maybe, in the complex world of Brexit, a flare-up or three between the EU and UK between now and the end of the year could actually increase the chance of a successful outcome.\n\nBecause both sides - and Theresa May in particular - need to show how tough the negotiations fight was.\n\nIn which case I'd suggest the autumn Brexit timetable could slip.\n\nEU leaders will decide in a couple of weeks whether enough progress (and I'm told this means progress in atmosphere and intention rather than a resolution of all outstanding negotiation issues) has been made in order to call a special Brexit summit in November.\n\nThis could slip to the EU leaders' summit in December calling a Brexit meeting in January (still in time for the UK parliamentary vote on a Brexit deal).\n\nOr, this November, EU leaders and Theresa May will thrash out all the outstanding issues on the withdrawal agreement (notably the Irish border) and on the political declaration outlining the EU-UK post Brexit relationship.\n\nIt is do-able. Just.\n\nAnd it would be what the prime minister always wanted - the European Commission out of the way - just her with her European peers pushing through to a deal both sides are aiming for.\n\nBut to increase the chances of getting one, communication between the EU and UK has to be improved. That's something both have learned from the crass misunderstandings on both sides at the Salzburg summit.\n\n\"Conversations are fluid now,\" a high-level contact told me.\n\n\"It has to be if we are to reach a deal. We do not need to be face to face with Theresa May or Dominic Raab to communicate. We all know the next EU leaders' summit will have to be carefully co-ordinated between the British and European sides. Unlike Salzburg.\"",

But it seems another issue is adding to their woes - people not turning up for bookings.\n\nAccording to some estimates, \"no-shows\" account for 5-20% of total restaurant bookings across the country and can cost venues thousands of pounds a month.\n\nOne example is the Beach House restaurant in Oxwich, Gower, south Wales, which reported having more than 100 last-minute cancellations over 10 days in April, \"most of which were no-shows\".\n\n\"I think over the Easter weekend we lost about \u00a33,000,\" says managing director Neil Kedward.\n\n\"Any restaurant has a fragile economic model, and if a third of your covers don't turn up it can have a huge impact.\"\n\nDamian Wawrzyniak, head chef and owner of House of Feasts in Peterborough, got so fed up with the problem he started a Twitter campaign called #StopNoShow which has since gone global.\n\nAt its worst, he says, his high-end restaurant had 10-15 no-shows a month and sometimes for groups as large as 18 people. It can mean lost revenue, hiring too many staff for an evening and wasted food, Mr Wawrzyniak says.\n\nHe blames third-party online booking sites, such as Bookatable, Resdiary and OpenTable, which advertise \"thousands of deals\" and let you make multiple reservations. OpenTable, however, does stop diners making several bookings in the same timeslot and blocks users who accumulate four no-shows within 12 months.\n\nJay Rayner, the Observer's restaurant critic, thinks online booking has also depersonalised the relationship between restaurants and their customers.\n\n\"If you talk to an individual when you book, some form of connection has been made and it's much harder to screw a restaurant around. If it's all online people think less about the consequences, which is reprehensible.\"\n\nOne regular restaurant goer, Nicola Fahey, says she eats out once or twice a week and doesn't turn up for about half of her online bookings.\n\n\"If you have booked through Bookatable you feel that you don't really have access to the restaurant to call and cancel - you'd have to look them up or Google them, which is a hassle.\n\n\"You also think they're going to fill the spot, although if the restaurant has a massive three-month waiting list I would be more inclined to ring.\"\n\nShe does feel \"a bit bad\" if she has spoken to someone at the restaurant in person then doesn't show up, but doesn't really think about it if she booked online.\n\n\"In fact, I don't think I'd ever call up and cancel if I'd booked online - there's no guilt, there's no connection... I wouldn't even consider if it would have an impact [on the business].\"\n\nNow some restaurants are fighting back and asking for non-refundable deposits upfront.\n\nThe Crockers Chef's Table in Tring, Hertfordshire began charging \u00a310-25 per head a few years ago, which would then be deducted from the final bill.\n\nBut after a resurgence of no-shows in July, owner Luke Garnsworthy increased this to 50% of the cost of a meal (the restaurant only serves set menus at \u00a345 or \u00a380 per head).\n\n\"Even if someone pays a deposit and doesn't show up you are still left out of pocket,\" he explains.\n\nOthers are going further and selling prepaid tickets for a meal in the same way as a theatre would for a play. Adopters include Heston Blumenthal's Fat Duck in Bray and The Man Behind The Curtain in Leeds.\n\nMr Kedward says the Beach House Restaurant has virtually stamped out no-shows since April, when it began charging a \u00a320 per head penalty for drop-outs or late cancellations. This is taken from the booker's credit card if they don't turn up. However, some restaurant-goers dislike such charges.\n\n\"I have been put off places who have asked for a deposit, for example for someone's leaving lunch at work,\" Becky Tanter tells the BBC. \"It's hard to get people to commit to that and you risk losing money if you pay it yourself and someone drops out.\"\n\nCarina Comeau says: \"It's rude not to call and cancel. However, a non-refundable deposit isn't right either. Unfortunately there are costs of doing business that the company must eat (pun intended)\u2026 and losses from a no-show are one of them.\"\n\nMr Wawrzyniak says he would never charge fines or deposits as it might deter the regulars on which his restaurant depends.\n\nBut he says he has reduced cancellations to zero another way: by taking his restaurant off third-party booking sites and raising awareness about no-shows on social media.\n\n\"We tell people about our menu, the research that went into it, and the costs and the waste if you don't turn up.\n\n\"Now we get guests telling us they've heard about the campaign and that they think no-shows are unacceptable, too.\"",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "It is hailed as a bread that lasts longer, is easier to digest and has a unique tangy taste.\n\nBut apparently sourdough can vary hugely depending on where you buy it.\n\nAccording to an investigation by Which? magazine, one in five so-called sourdough loaves sold in supermarkets are not made in the traditional way and contain extra ingredients or additives.\n\nBut how can you tell a sourdough from a \"sourfaux\" - and does it even matter?\n\nTraditional sourdough is considered to be one of the oldest forms of bread and the technique can be traced back to ancient Egypt.\n\nIt is made from just three ingredients: flour, water and salt.\n\nThe dough begins with a \"starter culture\" - also made with flour and water - which is left to bubble up for several days. It is this which makes the bread rise, instead of adding yeast.\n\n\"It's bread in its purest form,\" says Anna Herbert, from family business Hobbs House Bakery, in Chipping Sodbury, Gloucestershire.\n\n\"A true sourdough should not have yeast in it because the starter sourdough itself rises it.\"\n\nAccording to a report by the British Baker magazine earlier this year, sourdough is truly an in-demand product with supermarket sales up by 98% in the past year.\n\nAnd it is trendy too, with more than 1.5m Instagram posts tagged with #sourdough.\n\nBut Which? magazine says it looked at 19 sourdough loaves sold in supermarkets and found only four were made in the traditional way with the three basic ingredients.\n\nThe others contained extra ingredients, such as yeast, ascorbic acid and yoghurt and vinegar.\n\nWhile these are not necessarily bad for you or unhealthy, Chris Young from the Real Bread Campaign says customers are being misled.\n\n\"If you are told you are buying something, you should get what you pay for. Particularly when some of the supermarkets are charging a premium for that product,\" he said.\n\nThe Real Bread Campaign group says it wants to see a legal definition of the terms \"sourdough\" or \"artisan bread\", so stores cannot \"misinterpret\" them.\n\nThe Real Bread Campaign has called for more research to be done on the benefits of sourdough, but cites some studies which suggests it is more digestible and nutritious than the mass-market loaves of bread found in the bakery aisles.\n\nIt says the naturally-occurring yeast in sourdough is less concentrated than in commercial baker's yeast and so may be better for people who react badly to excessive yeast in bread.\n\nThe campaign also cited several studies showing how the glycaemic index of sourdough is lower than other breads, meaning it does not cause spikes in blood sugar.\n\nVanessa Kimbell, a sourdough expert specialising in the digestion and nutrition of bread, says fake sourdough is \"very difficult in terms of irritable bowel syndrome and diabetes\".\n\n\"It's absolutely scandalous,\" she said. \"Many diabetics are eating sourdough to control blood sugar levels. Eating fake sourdough can spike sugar levels.\"\n\nMs Kimbell adds: \"I believe manufacturers have a responsibility to define if the sourdough refers to the process or if it's the flavour.\n\n\"Tell people if it's the flavour.\"\n\nIt is clear that supermarket loaves with the sourdough flavour are hugely popular - despite deviating from the traditional recipe.\n\nTesco says it sells around 100,000 sourdough loaves a week and has quadrupled its sourdough range in the last five years.\n\nBut if you do want your sourdough loaf to be authentic, the Real Bread Campaign has a clear message: always read the label or ask someone in-store.\n\nAnd what does Paul Hollywood do with his sourdough?\n\nThe Great British Bake Off's king of bread, Paul Hollywood, has contributed three sourdough recipes featuring to the BBC Food website:",

            "content": "Macedonia's vote on changing its name to North Macedonia looks to have fallen far short of the turnout required.\n\nPreliminary results show that just over a third of Macedonians voted in the referendum, with 50% needed.\n\nBut with 90% of those who took part in favour of the change, the country's prime minister has urged parliament to \"confirm the will of the majority\".\n\nThe vote aimed to end a long-running dispute with Greece, which has its own region called Macedonia.\n\nAthens had agreed to end its objections to Macedonia's EU and Nato membership bids if the change was passed.\n\u2022 New name, same country? A choice for Macedonians\n\nOver 85% of votes have been counted so far, but a campaign by some nationalists - including the country's president - to boycott Sunday's referendum seems to have had an impact, with just 36% of eligible voters taking part.\n\nPrime Minister Zoran Zaev threatened to call early elections if parliament did not support the proposal, made non-binding by the poor turnout.\n\n\"If, as we all expect, we truly have a big visible, tangible majority for [voting in favour], out of those who voted, then the future is clear,\" he said after polls closed on Sunday.\n\n\"The vote of the MPs in parliament must resolutely be a vote for a responsible acceleration of the processes towards Nato and the European Union.\"\n\nWhy the change of name?\n\nMacedonia declared independence during the break-up of Yugoslavia in 1991. But Greece objected to its new neighbour's name.\n\nThe dispute harks back to ancient history, because both present-day Macedonia and northern Greece were part of a Roman province called Macedonia. And both claim the heritage of Alexander the Great two centuries earlier.\n\u2022 The man who focused on one word for 23 years\n\nGreece's objections forced the UN to refer to the new country as \"the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\".\n\nAthens also vetoed Macedonia's attempt to join Nato in 2008 - and blocked its EU membership ambitions.\n\nWhat was the proposed solution?\n\nThe addition of one word to Macedonia's constitutional name: North.\n\nSince 1991, many suggestions have been proposed, then rejected. But last year's change of government in Macedonia finally brought the start of serious negotiations.\n\n\"Our citizens were sick of that problem,\" says Macedonia's information minister, Damjan Manchevski. \"It had been weighing on Macedonia for such a long period of time and not letting us advance.\"\n\nWhat's in it for Macedonia?\n\nGreece will end its veto on Macedonia's accession to Nato and the EU.\n\n\"We don't change our name because we want to do it,\" Mr Zaev told the BBC. \"We do it because of our future in the EU and Nato. Everyone is aware why we do it.\"\n\nThat applies particularly to Macedonia's younger citizens.\n\n\"Young people in Macedonia are a quarter of the population - and they're one of the largest marginalised groups,\" says Dona Kosturanova of the Youth Educational Forum.\n\n\"They're struggling with poor education, high unemployment and few opportunities for prosperity. They're desperate to see advancement towards a prosperous environment.\"\n\nWhat are the objections?\n\nOpponents say the country has been bullied by Greece and the EU, pointing to the fact that top European politicians urged the voters to back the change.\n\nThe leader of the main opposition party, Hristijan Mickoski, was quoted as saying that the proposed deal \"will humiliate Macedonia\".\n\nPresident Gjorge Ivanov was among those who said they would be boycotting the vote. He described the proposed deal as \"historical suicide\".\n\nMeanwhile, Russia has been accused of fomenting opposition to the name change to stop Macedonia drifting into the West's orbit. Moscow denies the claim.",

Aznavour married three times and had six children.\n\nHe was named entertainer of the century by CNN in 1998.\n\u2022 Six of the best Charles Aznavour songs\n\nThe singer was born in Paris in 1924 to Armenian parents who fled the country's genocide to begin a new life in the French capital.\n\nAznavour's lyrics drew on his own experiences of growing up in deprivation as an immigrant.\n\nThe singer was due to take on a seven-date tour across France and Switzerland, starting in November this year.\n\nHe had recently returned from a tour in Japan, having been forced to cancel concerts this summer due to a broken arm.\n\nHe recorded more than 1,200 songs in seven different languages and performed in 94 countries.\n\nAznavour's song She was famously performed by Elvis Costello in the opening credits of Richard Curtis' film Notting Hill.\n\nDubbed France's Frank Sinatra, Aznavour wrote his own songs on taboo subjects about marriage, homosexuality and male expression of emotions.\n\nHis 1973 hit, What Makes a Man, was about a gay transvestite.\n\nStill performing to packed stadiums well into his 90s, Aznavour continued to write songs about his life, including his Swedish wife to celebrate 50 years of marriage.\n\nAs well as a singer, he was a successful actor and played the lead in the 1960 film Shoot the Piano Player.\n\nHe also appeared in the Oscar-winning The Tin Drum, playing a kindly Jewish toy seller.\n\nAznavour sang for presidents, popes and royal families and at a number of humanitarian events.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron was a big fan of Aznavour and sang many of his songs during karaoke nights with friends when he was a student, according to former classmates.\n\nAznavour was heavily involved in charity work and founded an organisation after the 1988 Armenian earthquake with friend Levon Sayan.\n\nIn 2009 he was appointed ambassador of Armenia to Switzerland and he also became Armenia's delegate to the United Nations in Geneva.\n\nSinger Petula Clarke told the BBC, \"He was delightful to be with, he was very funny.

I will remember his as a great friend and a great artist.\"\n\nThousands of fans from around the world have paid their respects on Twitter, including some celebrities.\n\nGood Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan remembered the singer as an \"intelligent, eloquent, graceful & charming man.\"\n\nMusician Reverend Richard Coles suggested that Aznavour was a \"better singer\" than Sinatra:\n\nBBC 6 Music's Gilles Peterson shared one of his favourite songs by the singer, Hier Encore:\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

The firm said it pays its staff fairly and is working to find a resolution.\n\nFlagging consumer spending on casual dining combined with rises in the minimum wage are squeezing profits at mid-market restaurants like TGI Fridays.\n\nIn February the chain introduced a system that takes 40% of tips paid by customers on credit and debit cards for redistribution to back-of-house staff.\n\nUnite said the aim was to reduce staff turnover in kitchens by giving them a pay rise without increasing costs.\n\nBut the union said it would cost waiting staff on the minimum wage up to \u00a3250 a month in lost income.\n\nDave Turnbull from Unite said it wasn't a question of waiting staff not wanting to share with their colleagues, but was about \"greedy\" owners who \"no longer want to pay their hardworking staff anything above the bare minimum\".\n\nThe union said the action would be repeated and spread to further branches on consecutive Fridays, starting next Friday at the Trafford Centre, in Manchester, and London's Haymarket Piccadilly.\n\nTGI Fridays operates 83 restaurants across the UK. Its UK business is backed by Electra Private Equity.\n\nMr Turnbull said: \"Unite is warning TGI Fridays of a summer of disruption if management don't do the decent thing and sit down with us to find a sensible solution to this dispute.\"\n\u2022 Profits off the menu at Ramsay restaurants\n\nA TGI Fridays spokesman said: \"We believe all our team members should be - and are - treated and paid fairly.\"\n\nThe spokesman said the firm was working with staff to find a resolution and aimed to keep the restaurants operating as normal despite the walk-out.\n\nTwo years ago a government review of tipping practice advised that workers should retain all the tips given by the public. However there are no laws restricting restaurant practice and redistribution among non-waiting staff does not contravene best practice recommendations.\n\nIn March TGI Fridays was among 43 hospitality sector firms fined for failing to pay staff the National Minimum Wage. TGI Friday's had to repay \u00a325 each to 2,300 staff for the purchase of their black uniform shoes.",

I'm so thankful to Thomas Bjorn for believing in me.\"\n\nTommy Fleetwood and Rory McIlroy led 'thunder clap' cheers with an exuberant 70,000-strong crowd, while captain Thomas Bjorn embraced each of his \"amazing\" players.\n\n\"Some people say golf is boring - well, this is certainly not boring,\" said Bjorn. \"I've experienced a lot of Ryder Cups but this is the top one.\"\n\nHis opposing captain Jim Furyk said: \"You have to tip your cap, they outplayed us.\"\n\u2022 Why WhatsApp was key to Europe's victory\n\u2022 Read: All the results and stats\n\nJon Rahm, Ian Poulter, Thorbjorn Olesen, Henrik Stenson and Alex Noren joined Molinari and Garcia in winning singles matches after the Americans, trailing 10-6, had threatened a comeback by winning 3\u00bd of the first five points on the final day.\n\nPoulter - nicknamed 'The Postman' because he 'always delivers a point' - found a pillar-box fancy-dress outfit to the delight of the partisan crowd, then led the charge on to the 18th green when Noren holed a 35-foot putt to win the final match.\n\nThat spirit has prevailed throughout the European team all week. They went in to the match as underdogs despite the US not having won in Europe since 1993. The American side boasted 31 major titles, and 11 of their players are in the world's top 17.\n\nBut Le Golf National is a different course to those the Americans are used to playing on - the tight fairways and deep, penal rough, a world away from the vast majority of PGA Tour courses.\n\nOnly three of the American dozen had played a competitive round at the home of the French Open before this week, and it showed as the European players, who have played in excess of 200 rounds between them, looked more at ease.\n\nThe Americans put their best players out at the top of Sunday's singles order and the gamble appeared to be paying off for captain Jim Furyk with three wins and a halved match out of the first five.\n\n\"We got some momentum but the Europeans responded well as they have all week,\" said Furyk.\n\n\"Europe did a good job on a golf course they know pretty well but they did a great job playing it. They hit key shots and knocked in the clutch putts. But it's been a wonderful week.\"\n\nBoth the opening matches went down to the 18th, with Justin Thomas defeating McIlroy after an epic battle to put the American's first point on the board before Brooks Koepka rolled in a three-footer to share his equally entertaining match with Paul Casey - the only one of the 28 matches to end all square.\n\nMcIlroy was two ahead after four holes but Thomas hit back with birdies on the eighth and 10th. They were still level on the 18th but after Thomas boomed his drive down the middle, McIlroy pushed his tee shot into a bunker. His ball plugged and he was unable to get it out with his first attempt. His third shot careered into the water to effectively end the contest, with Thomas hitting his second to eight feet.\n\nThe point meant the American, who was joint eighth at the French Open earlier in the summer, finished as his team's top points scorer with four, from five matches.\n\nWorld number two Rose failed to recover from losing the second and third holes to Webb Simpson and was three down after eight. The Englishman birdied the par-three 16th but the American holed his second shot to close out a 3&2 win.\n\nFleetwood, who won four matches in partnership with Molinari on Friday and Saturday, also harboured hopes of becoming the first European to win all five matches at a single Ryder Cup but they were crushed by Tony Finau. None of the first 11 holes were halved but the American won eight of them to the Englishman's three to go five ahead and he eventually won 6&4.\n\nBut then the tide turned. Poulter, so often the European to spark a momentum change, holed a birdie putt on the 14th to edge ahead of world number one Dustin Johnson in their see-saw contest and the roar reverberated around the course.\n\nMoments later, those around the 14th green were roaring again when Olesen completed an unlikely 5&4 victory over Jordan Spieth to put Europe 11\u00bd-9\u00bd ahead.\n\nOlesen had not played since losing in the fourballs on Friday morning and his victory was built on four birdies on the front nine as he went five clear, while Spieth, who has been one of the US team's star players with three points, never recovered from three successive bogeys.\n\nPoulter, unbeaten in five previous singles matches, then went two holes up on Johnson after the American dumped his second to the par-four 15th into the water.\n\nUp on the 16th, Rahm missed a short putt to allow Tiger Woods to get back within a hole but the Spaniard nailed his approach to the 17th to four feet and holed the putt to add another blue point.\n\nRahm punched the air in delight, striding around the green in raucous celebration, before calming himself enough to console Woods, who had waited patiently to congratulate his conqueror.\n\nThe defeat left Woods, who won his first tournament in five years at the Tour Championship last week, with zero points from his four matches. Bryson DeChambeau and Mickelson also ended with zero points, while all the Europeans contributed.\n\nJohnson won the 16th to stay in touch with Poulter but the thousands gathered round the 17th green were expecting to celebrate another European point minutes later.\n\nPoulter, for once, failed to deliver, missing a six-footer to win the match. However, he strode to the final tee, smashed his drive down the middle and flicked a mid-iron to six feet, a putt conceded by Johnson, to put Europe 13\u00bd-9\u00bd ahead and just one point from regaining the trophy.\n\nAny one of Molinari, Garcia, or Stenson could have secured the winning point - and it was the Italian who did so.\n\nThe winning moment came when Mickelson, three down with three to play, hit his tee shot on the par-three 16th into the water and conceded the hole and match.",

            "section": "Asia",
            "content": "Volunteers have begun burying victims of Indonesia's deadly earthquake and tsunami in a mass grave.\n\nFriday's disaster devastated swathes of the eastern Sulawesi island and has left at least 844 people dead.\n\nSome remote areas have yet to be contacted, and there are fears that the death toll could rise further.\n\nA lack of heavy lifting equipment is hampering rescuers' attempts to reach people who remain alive in the ruins of collapsed buildings.\n\nDozens of people are feared to be underneath the rubble of one hotel alone, the Roa-Roa in the devastated resort of Palu.\n\nIn Sigi, south of Palu, the bodies of 34 children were found at a church which was engulfed in mud and debris, Indonesia Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani was quoted as saying by Reuters.\n\nShe said the children were on a \"Bible camp\".\n\nIndonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency confirmed to the BBC that none of the country's tsunami detector buoys were working before Sulawesi was hit.\n\nAgency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said the 21 floating detection units - which are connected to deep sea sensors - had been damaged by vandals or stolen.\n\nA tsunami warning was still sent out - but it appears to have drastically underestimated the scale of the waves that would follow.\n\nMany people in Palu did not receive alerts because of power cuts caused by the tremor. There were also no sirens located along the coast.\n\nWhat's the current situation on the ground?\n\n\"Communication is limited, heavy machinery is limited... it's not enough for the numbers of buildings that collapsed,\" said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.\n\nYenni Suryani, of Catholic Relief Services, said aid agencies were struggling to get staff into affected areas as the main airport at Palu was damaged, landslides had cut road links and \"power is out almost everywhere\".\n\nSome survivors have been looting shops for food, water and fuel, telling reporters they have run out of supplies.\n\nReuters news agency reports that police are escorting aid convoys to prevent supplies being stolen.\n\nPresident Joko Widodo visited the region, urging a \"day and night\" effort to rescue survivors.\n\nGovernment officials say some 1,200 inmates escaped from three prisons in the region as the quake struck.\n\nIn the hills above Palu, volunteers filling a mass grave were instructed to prepare for a total of 1,300 victims to arrive.\n\nTrucks arrived with bodies wrapped in orange, yellow and black body bags. They were dragged into the grave and motorised diggers poured earth on top.\n\nBut many people are still looking for missing loved ones.\n\nAdi told AFP he was hugging his wife by the beach in Palu when the tsunami struck, and has not seen her since.\n\n\"When the wave came, I lost her,\" he said. \"I was carried about 50 metres. I couldn't hold anything.\"\n\nLying on a stretcher in the dark outside the Mamboro health clinic in Palu is a five-year-old girl with a broken leg. She was found alone, Doctor Sasono tells me. \"We don't know where her family is and she doesn't remember where they live.\" His clinic has no power and is running out of medical supplies.\n\nA few metres from her stretcher bed are rows of bodies in bags. The smell of decomposition fills the air. Dr Sasono says they will be buried in mass graves to stop the spread of diseases: \"They are starting to smell. We want to wait for relatives to pick them up, but we can't wait any longer.\"\n\nRows of rubble lie all along the shoreline where vibrant fishing villages once stood.\n\nPeople's possessions lie smashed together, with cars and boats tossed around by the massive waves. Amid the rubble are tents where families are sleeping out in the open.\n\u2022 Read Rebecca's first full report from the disaster zone\n\nWhy was the tsunami so destructive?\n\nThe 7.5-magnitude quake occurred at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles) just off Sulawesi at 18:03 (10:03 GMT) on Friday, setting off a tsunami.\n\nThe earthquake was powerful but shallow and with more lateral than vertical movement, not typically the kind of tremor that sets off tsunamis.\n\nA warning system was put in place across the whole Pacific region after the 2004 disaster, which killed nearly a quarter of a million people.\n\nVideos show people screaming as waves 6m (20ft) high power over the beach - where a festival was being set-up - sweeping up everything in their path.\n\nIndonesia lies on the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\" where tectonic plates collide and many of the world's volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur.\n\nHave you been affected by the earthquake?

            "section": "Europe",
            "content": "A senior scientist has given what has been described as a \"highly offensive\" presentation about the role of women in physics, the BBC has learned.\n\nAt a workshop organised by Cern, Prof Alessandro Strumia of Pisa University said that \"physics was invented and built by men, it's not by invitation\".\n\nHe said male scientists were being discriminated against because of ideology rather than merit.\n\nHe was speaking at a workshop in Geneva on gender and high energy physics.\n\nProf Strumia has since defended his comments, saying he was only presenting the facts.\n\nCern, the European nuclear research centre, described Prof Strumia's presentation as \"highly offensive\".\n\nThe centre, which discovered the Higgs Boson in 2012, has removed slides used in the talk from its website \"in line with a code of conduct that does not tolerate personal attacks and insults\".\n\nProf Strumia, who regularly works at Cern, presented the results of a study of published research papers from an online library.\n\nHe told his audience of young, predominantly female physicists that his results \"proved\" that \"physics is not sexist against women. However the truth does not matter, because it is part of a political battle coming from outside\".\n\nHe produced a series of graphs which, he claimed, showed that women were hired over men whose research was cited more by other scientists in their publications, which is an indication of higher quality.\n\nHe also presented data that he claimed showed that male and female researchers were equally cited at the start of their careers but men scored progressively better as their careers progressed.\n\nProf Strumia pointed to behavioural research which he suggested may account for the disparity.\n\nOne study, he told his audience, indicated that \"men prefer working with things and women prefer working with people\" and another, he claimed, suggested that there was a \"difference even in children before any social influence\".\n\nProf Strumia said that these conclusions may \"not be fully right... (but) the opposite assumption of identical brains is ideology\".\n\nAs evidence of discrimination against male researchers, Prof Strumia claimed that \"Oxford University extends exam times for women's benefit\" and \"Italy offers free or cheaper university for female (research) students\". He also said that he himself was overlooked for a job that he was more qualified for, which was given to a woman.\n\nDr Jessica Wade, a physicist at Imperial College London who was at the meeting, told BBC News that Prof Strumia's analysis was simplistic, drawing on ideas that had \"long been discredited\".\n\n\"It was really upsetting to those at the workshop,\" she said.\n\n\"There were young women and men exchanging ideas and their experiences on how to encourage more women into the subject and to combat discrimination in their careers. Then this man gets up, saying all this horrible stuff.\"\n\nShe added: \"I don't understand how such a forward thinking organisation like Cern, which does so much to promote diversity in research, could have invited him to speak to young people just starting off in their research careers when his ideas are so well known.\"\n\nIn a statement, Cern - which currently has its first ever woman director-general - said that the organisers were not aware of the content of the talk prior to the workshop.\n\n\"Cern is a culturally diverse organisation bringing together people from dozens of nationalities. It is a place where everyone is welcome, and all have the same opportunities, regardless of ethnicity, beliefs, gender or sexual orientation,\" it said.\n\nA Cern spokesman confirmed that there was a video recording of the presentation. Senior managers would decide whether to release part or all of it, it said.\n\nWhen the BBC contacted Prof Strumia he said: \"People say that physics is sexist, physics is racist. I made some simple checks and discovered that it wasn't, that it was becoming sexist against men and said so.\"\n\nLast month, Prof Jocelyn Bell Burnell told the BBC she believed that unconscious bias against women prevented them from getting jobs in physics research.\n\nIn 2015, Nobel laureate Prof Tim Hunt resigned from his position at University College London after telling an audience of young female scientists at a conference in South Korea that the \"trouble with girls\" in labs was that \"when you criticise them they cry\".",

            "section": "Science & Environment",
            "content": "It is likely to be the most critical and controversial report on climate change in recent years.\n\nLeading scientists are meeting in South Korea this week to see if global temperatures can be kept from rising by more than 1.5C this century.\n\nThe world has already passed one degree of warming as carbon emissions have ballooned since the 1850s.\n\nMany low-lying countries say they may disappear under the sea if the 1.5C limit is breached.\n\nAfter a week of deliberations in the city of Incheon, the researchers' new report is likely to say that keeping below this limit will require urgent and dramatic action from governments and individuals alike.\n\nOne scientist told BBC News that our lives would never be the same if the world changed course to stay under 1.5C.\n\u2022 'Climate change moving faster than we are'\n\nThe new study is being produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a body set up to provide a clear scientific view for governments on the causes, impacts and solutions to rising temperatures.\n\nWhen the Paris climate agreement was signed in December 2015, there was delight and surprise among many delegates that countries had agreed that the long-term goal of the pact should be to keep global temperatures \"well below two degrees C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees C\".\n\nTo examine the challenges and impacts of keeping temperatures below the 1.5C limit, the UN asked the IPCC to produce a special report, which the scientific body has delivered in record time.\n\nThis week in Incheon, the scientists and government delegates will go through the final, short, 15-page Summary for Policymakers, the key distillation of the underlying scientific reports.\n\nThis will be done word by word, to ensure everyone - scientists and governments alike - are in agreement on the text.\n\nWhy is this report important?\n\nThe report will be the guiding light for governments as they decide how to develop their economies in the face of rising temperatures over the coming decades.\n\n\"The decisions we make now about whether we let 1.5 or 2 degrees or more happen will change the world enormously,\" Dr Heleen de Coninck, one of the co-ordinating lead authors of the report, told BBC News.\n\n\"But our lives, when keeping it below 1.5C with projected population rise and economic growth, will also look differently.\"\n\n\"Lives of people will never be the same again either way, but we can influence which future we end up with.\"\n\nRight now, the world has passed one degree of warming above the global temperatures that pertained around 1850, before widespread industrialisation.\n\nLeaked drafts of the new report suggest that global warming is on track to break the 1.5C mark by around 2040.\n\nThis is potentially very bad news for low-lying island states and some of the least developed countries in the world who fear that 1.5C will cause sea-level to rise and threaten their survival.\n\nHow does the IPCC work?\n\nThe IPCC has been in existence for 30 years and produces detailed assessments of the state of the climate every six or seven years.\n\nThis special report has been almost three years in the making.\n\nThe authors are all scientists who have been nominated by governments and international institutions.\n\nIn this case, there are 86 lead authors from 39 countries, of which 39% are female.\n\nThese researchers, who are unpaid, have reviewed the available scientific literature on the feasibility, impacts and costs of staying under 1.5C.\n\nThey have then put together draft versions of their report, after having reviewed some 6,000 references all told.\n\nThese draft reports were sent out to other experts and governments for review. In total, this report has had over 40,000 review comments.\n\nBecause so many people are involved, and all these review comments have been taken on board, the IPCC has a reputation for being rather conservative, producing reports that have a very broad consensus.\n\nThose involved say the wide range of literature and the large number of authors involved is a key strength of the body.\n\n\"We don't base our reports on a single article that has an extreme conclusion, that contrasts with the available literature,\" said Dr Carolina Vera, a member of the IPCC bureau.\n\n\"The collective view of the available literature is the most robust contribution that we can provide to the governments.\"\n\nSo why is this report controversial?\n\nIf you add up all the promises to cut carbon made by countries that have signed the Paris climate agreement, it would see the world warm by more than 3C by the end of this century.\n\nFor some scientists, there is not enough time left to take the actions that would keep the world within the desired limit.\n\n\"If you really look seriously at the feasibility, it looks like it will be very hard to reach the 1.5C,\" said Prof Arthur Petersen, from University College London and a former IPCC member.\n\n\"I am relatively sceptical that we can meet 1.5C, even with an overshoot. Scientists can dream up that is feasible, but it's a pipedream.\"\n\nAs well as the science, there is also the politics.\n\nFor some countries, especially those who are major exporters of fossil fuels, limiting carbon emissions more rapidly than at present is a challenge.\n\n\"The overall big question in this report is how we can still get to that 1.5C goal? What does it take?\", said Kaisa Kosonen from Greenpeace.\n\n\"There are those for whom 1.5C is a matter of life or death and they want the message to be clear. Others might want to suggest that there is not scientific certainty and the messages, for example on rapid fossil-fuel phase-out, should not be so straightforward.\"\n\nWhat will the report likely recommend?\n\nThe challenge of keeping temperatures below 1.5 is considerable. But, if it is accepted by the governments, the report is likely to say that it can be done, if the world is willing to take some very tough steps.\n\nThese are likely to involve an intensification of cuts to CO2 emissions, a rapid move to renewable energy and quite possibly, the deployment of technologies to suck greenhouse gases from the air.\n\nThis last option is seen as highly controversial.\n\nThe report is also likely state that lifestyle and dietary choices can make a significant difference - but there are no simple or cheap solutions.\n\n\"There is no easy answer; it is a much more complicated answer,\" said Prof Jim Skea, who co-chairs one of the IPCC working groups.\n\n\"It has physical elements, it has social elements, it has political elements. The report, as it is scoped, allows us to go into these issues, but a crisp answer I don't think is what we were asked for by governments.\"\n\nWho is actually in charge - the scientists or the governments?\n\nThere has been quite a bit of speculation that the scientists are being forced to soften the contents of the report, or \"pull their punches\", on some of the major conclusions.\n\nWhat's happened is that there have been notable changes between different draft versions of the short Summary for Policymakers, which will be released officially on Monday 8 October.\n\nThis has led some critics to conclude that important aspects are being downplayed to suit the interests of countries with major fossil fuel industries, such as the United States, Saudi Arabia and Australia.\n\nBut members of the IPCC say that they will not allow their conclusions to be watered down during the next few days when the Summary is gone through, line by line.\n\n\"What is really important for the work of the IPCC is the respect for the integrity and scientific rigour of the authors - that is at the heart of the work of the author teams,\" said Val\u00e9rie Masson-Delmotte, a co-chair of the body.\n\n\"If one can imagine the governments holding the hands of the scientists, this means you don't know how science works!\"\n\nWill sparks fly at this meeting?\n\nQuite likely, yes!\n\nIPCC sessions are closed from the public, to allow governments and scientists to speak freely. Governments often seek to make changes to the text - the scientists are there to ensure that if changes are made, they are consistent with the research.\n\n\"I've never been to an approval session that didn't go well after hours; it's kind of IPCC working practice now,\" said Prof Skea.\n\n\"Absolutely it will be a robust session and we are well geared up for it.\"",

Then she received a letter to say it needed a replacement coolant hose.\n\nBefore she could have the work done, Mrs Backhouse said her car engine cut out.\n\n\"I noticed a light come on and it said 'service now', then the power started to go in the car. It felt sluggish,\" she said.\n\nWhile repairs were carried out, the replacement coolant hose was also fitted, and Mrs Backhouse was told her car had a fuse problem which had been fixed.\n\nShe said just after she had driven out of the garage, the fault happened again.\n\nShe was without a car for more than a month while trying to negotiate with her dealership and finance company.\n\n\"People say 'it's just a car, but it's not just a car it's a lifeline to us.\"\n\nMrs Backhouse's finance company eventually agreed she could sell it back, although she did lose the hire purchase payments she had made over the previous 18 months.\n\nAs a lifelong Ford customer, she feels she has been let down.\n\n\"They [Ford] have not based anything in my case on what's going on with us. There is no human element,\" she said.\n\nFord has said concerned customers should email them with their vehicle registration number.\n\nYou can see the full story on BBC Inside Out Yorkshire and Lincolnshire at 19:30 BST on BBC One on Monday 1 October or via iPlayer afterwards.",

            "content": "Two scientists who discovered how to fight cancer using the body's immune system have won the 2018 Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine.\n\nThe work, by Professor James P Allison from the US and Professor Tasuku Honjo from Japan, has led to treatments for advanced, deadly skin cancer.\n\nImmune checkpoint therapy has revolutionised cancer treatment, said the prize-giving Swedish Academy.\n\nExperts say it has proved to be \"strikingly effective\".\n\nProf Allison, of the University of Texas, and Prof Honjo, of Kyoto University, will share the Nobel prize sum of nine million Swedish kronor - about $1.01 million or 870,000 euros.\n\nAccepting the prize, Tasuku Honjo told reporters: \"I want to continue my research ... so that this immune therapy will save more cancer patients than ever.\"\n\nProf Allison said: \"It's a great, emotional privilege to meet cancer patients who've been successfully treated with immune checkpoint blockade. They are living proof of the power of basic science, of following our urge to learn and to understand how things work.\"\n\nOur immune system protects us from disease, but it has built-in safeguards to stop it from attacking our own tissue.\n\nSome cancers can take advantage of those \"brakes\" and dodge the attack too.\n\nAllison and Honjo, now both in their 70s, discovered a way to unleash our immune cells to attack tumours by turning off proteins that put the brakes on.\n\nAnd that led to the development of new drugs which now offer hope to patients with advanced and previously untreatable cancer.\n\nImmune checkpoint therapy is being used by the NHS to treat people with the most serious form of skin cancer, melanoma.\n\nIt doesn't work for everyone, but for some patients it appears to have worked incredibly well, getting rid of the tumour entirely, even after it had started to spread around the body.\n\nSuch remarkable results had never been seen before for patients like these.\n\nDoctors have also been using the treatment to help some people with advanced lung cancer.\n\nProf Charles Swanton, from Cancer Research UK, congratulated the prize winners, saying: \"Thanks to this groundbreaking work, our own immune system's innate power against cancer has been realised and harnessed into treatments that continue to save the lives of patients. For cancers such as advanced melanoma, lung, and kidney, these immune-boosting drugs have transformed the outlook for many patients who had run out of options.\n\n\"The booming field of immunotherapy that these discoveries have precipitated is still relatively in its infancy, so it's exciting to consider how this research will progress in the future and what new opportunities will arise.\"\n\nMedicine is the first of the Nobel Prizes awarded each year.\n\nThe literature prize will not be handed out this year, after the awarding body was affected by a sexual misconduct scandal.\n\n2017- Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young for unravelling how bodies keep a circadian rhythm or body clock\n\n2016 - Yoshinori Ohsumi for discovering how cells remain healthy by recycling waste.\n\n2015 - William C Campbell, Satoshi \u014cmura and Youyou Tu for anti-parasite drug discoveries.\n\n2014 - John O'Keefe, May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser for discovering the brain's navigating system.\n\n2013 - James Rothman, Randy Schekman, and Thomas Sudhof for their discovery of how cells precisely transport material.\n\n2012 - Two pioneers of stem cell research - John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka - were awarded the Nobel after changing adult cells into stem cells.\n\n2011 - Bruce Beutler, Jules Hoffmann and Ralph Steinman shared the prize after revolutionising the understanding of how the body fights infection.\n\n2010 - Robert Edwards for devising the fertility treatment IVF which led to the first \"test tube baby\" in July 1978.\n\n2009 - Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider and Jack Szostak for finding the telomeres at the ends of chromosomes.",

            "content": "Foreign property buyers will face an extra tax with the money raised being spent on tackling rough sleeping, Prime Minister Theresa May has said.\n\nShe said foreign buyers could face a surcharge of 1% or 3% on top of stamp duty to stop them driving up UK prices.\n\nRough sleeping has been rising for the past seven years that the Conservatives have been in government.\n\nHomelessness charity Shelter said the housing crisis will remain until more social housing is built.\n\nStamp duty is a tax on properties worth more than \u00a3125,000.\n\n\"The money we raise from this extra stamp duty is going to be spent on dealing with the issue of rough sleeping,\" Mrs May told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme.\n\u2022 Is this the solution to the UK's housing problem?\n\u2022 'You can't solve homelessness without homes'\n\nMrs May said evidence showed that foreign buyers who do not pay tax in the UK push up house prices and lower home ownership in the UK.\n\nRough sleeping is defined by the government as sleeping in the open air - parks, streets, doorways or bus shelters - or people who sleep in buildings that were not designed for habitation.\n\nAbout 4,750 people are estimated to have slept rough on any given night in England in 2017.\n\nMost councils provide an estimate based on intelligence from local services but some conduct a count of the number of people seen sleeping rough on a single night.\n\n\"We've sadly seen roughly sleeping going up recently, which is why it is is important we are taking a number of actions,\" Mrs May said from Birmingham, where her party's annual conference has begun.\n\n\"We've already put money in to projects to ensure that we are helping those who are sleeping rough, this will enable more money to be put in.\"\n\nMrs May highlighted projects such as the Housing First model, being piloted in the West Midlands, which sees rough sleepers given a home, rather than shelters.\n\nIn August, the government announced a \u00a3100m strategy to tackle rough sleeping on English streets, but it was criticised as it became apparent no new money was being invested.\n\nThe Conservatives say this policy would help British residents \"get the right home for them\" and \"end the scourge of rough sleeping for good\".\n\nIt is unclear when the new rates would be introduced.\n\nShadow chancellor John McDonnell said the Conservatives were \"desperately trying to play catch up\" with a \"rehash\" of his party's proposals from Labour's 2017 manifesto.\n\n\"Unlike the Tories' proposal this weekend, Labour's fully costed offshore company property levy targeted the tax avoiders and those seeking to speculate on UK property markets,\" he added.\n\nWhile Shelter welcomed the proposed funding, it said it was \"a national disgrace that so many of our fellow citizens are still sleeping rough in modern Britain\".\n\n\"We need to understand that the housing crisis will remain for as long as we fail to build more social homes to give people a secure and affordable way to live,\" the charity said.\n\nIn 2016-17, about 217,000 new homes were built in England - almost a third short of the government's target of 300,000.\n\nLabour party chairman Ian Lavery said: \"The Tories are offering watered down, half-baked policies that don't begin to compare with Labour's radical plan to rebuild Britain after years of austerity.\"\n\nUnder proposals announced last week, Labour said if it was in government it would introduce a new levy on second homes that are used as holiday homes, ban letting agent fees and scrap laws allowing private landlords to evict tenants without giving a reason.\n\nHousing is a devolved issue, but Scotland and Wales have also reported rises in homelessness and rough sleepers.",

Ms Conway, 51, has hinted previously that she was molested by Congressmen.\n\nThe comment came as she was defending President Trump's embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing allegations of sexual assault.\n\n\"I feel very empathetic... towards victims of sexual assault,\" she said.\n\u2022 Ford's testimony through the eyes of a survivor\n\u2022 What will FBI inquiry actually look into?\n\nThe Senate vote on Mr Kavanaugh's nomination was delayed dramatically this week when the president ordered further FBI background checks on his character.\n\nIn an earlier confirmation hearing watched by millions in the US and around the world, Dr Christine Blasey Ford accused the judge of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers in the 1980s.\n\nThe FBI is also investigating an allegation of historic sexual misconduct made by at least one other woman, Deborah Ramirez.\n\nWhat did Conway say previously about being assaulted?\n\nIt is not the first time that she has spoken of prior sexual assault.\n\nMs Conway raised the issue in 2016 while managing Mr Trump's election campaign, passionately defending him when asked in an MSNBC interview about his record in dealing with women.\n\n\"I would talk to some of the members of Congress out there,\" she said. \"When I was younger and prettier, them rubbing up against girls, sticking their tongues down women's throats, uninvited, who didn't like it.\"\n\nIn 2017, she described that interview as her \"#MeToo moment\", but said that \"nobody cared\" about it due to her political views.\n\nWhat does Conway say now?\n\nMs Conway made her latest disclosure to CNN's Jake Tapper on his State of the Union news show, saying: \"I feel very empathetic, frankly, towards victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment and rape.\"\n\n\"I'm a victim of sexual assault. I don't expect Judge Kavanaugh, or Jake Tapper, or Jeff Flake, or anybody, to be held responsible for that.

            "content": "Theresa May has rejected claims she does not believe in Brexit - and insisted she would make a success of it \"regardless of the outcome\" of talks.\n\nShe told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show her plan for post-Brexit trade with the EU was not dead, despite it having been rejected by EU leaders.\n\nAnd she urged the Tory party - in Birmingham for their annual conference - to \"come together\" and back it.\n\nIn his latest broadside against her Brexit strategy, the former foreign secretary suggested he might be able to strike a better deal than her with Brussels.\n\nHe told the Sunday Times : \"Unlike the prime minister, I fought for this, I believe in it, I think it's the right thing for our country and I think that what is happening now is, alas, not what people were promised in 2016.\"\n\u2022 Johnson refuses to rule out May challenge\n\nMr Johnson also set out domestic policy ideas, including building a bridge between Britain and Ireland and putting the HS2 scheme on hold to focus on a rail link in northern England.\n\nMrs May, who campaigned for Remain in the 2016 EU referendum, hit back at Mr Johnson in her Andrew Marr interview.\n\nShe said: \"I do believe in Brexit. Crucially, I believe in delivering Brexit in a way that respects the vote and delivers on the vote of the British people while also protecting our union, protecting jobs and ensuring we make a success of Brexit for the future.\n\n\"That's why I want us to get a really good free trade deal with the European Union, which is what lies at the heart of the Chequers plan.\"\n\nBut she also said she was prepared for a \"no deal\" scenario, saying: \"We will make a success of Brexit, regardless of the outcome of the negotiations.\"\n\nThe Labour Party has said it will back Mrs May in Parliament if she agrees to their plan for a customs union with the EU and a Brexit deal that guarantees workers' rights and protects jobs.\n\nMrs May said: \"My message to the Labour Party is that they should stop playing politics with Brexit and start acting in the national interest.\n\n\"My message to my party is let's come together and get the best deal for Britain.\"\n\nEU leaders have rejected her Chequers plan because they believe it would undermine the single market by allowing the UK to \"cherry pick\" bits of EU law it liked and ditch the rest.\n\nMrs May said: \"We think we are putting forward a proposal that will maintain the integrity of the single market.\"\n\nShe said she wanted a more detailed response from the EU on their objections.\n\nLater on Sunday, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt hit back at the EU's negotiation stance in his speech to the party conference.\n\nHe said the EU seemed to want to \"punish\" the UK for leaving, and added: \"If you turn the EU club into a prison, the desire to get out of it won't diminish, it will grow and we won't be the only prisoner that will want to escape.\"\n\nMr Hunt also addressed EU leaders directly, saying: \"If you reject the hand of friendship offered by our prime minister, you turn your back on the partnership that has given Europe more security, more freedom, more prosperity, more opportunities than ever before in history.\"\n\nIn the main conference hall, pro-Brexit former CBI chief Sir Digby Jones gave a watching Mrs May a boost with a speech hailing her for standing up to the EU \"bully boys\" and attacking Mr Johnson as an \"irrelevance\".\n\nJust like the Labour conference last week, the Conservatives are keen to show us they have plenty of songs on their playlist.\n\nBut just like the Labour conference last week, one record is louder than all the others and seems jammed on repeat: Brexit.\n\nAutumn guarantees two things: leaves falling off trees and Conservative conferences in which there is a series of deftly choreographed Johnsonian interventions, before and during the main event.\n\nForty-eight hours on from his 4,000 or so words for the Daily Telegraph, one word from Mr Johnson is sufficient to grab a headline or two today: \"deranged\".\n\nThe big question of the next few days, beyond the Brexit noise: does the PM offer any indication, however vague, of the possibility of her shifting on her much criticised Brexit plan?\n\nBut former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who like Mr Johnson quit the cabinet over Mrs May's Brexit proposals, told Sky News the Chequers plan \"will die\" because \"it's just wrong\".\n\nHe said he expected a free trade deal to be struck along the lines of a Canada-style agreement, adding that \"we are going to have a very scary few months\" as talks with the EU entered their final stages, but that was \"normal\".\n\nOn the Andrew Marr Show, Mrs May also defended the \"hostile environment\" immigration policies she introduced as home secretary, which led to people from the so-called Windrush generation losing their jobs, welfare benefits and right to remain in the UK.\n\nShe apologised for the fact that many long-standing UK residents of Caribbean origin had been caught by her Immigration Act, but declined to apologise for the policy itself.\n\nMrs May wants to use the Conservative conference to focus on domestic issues as well as Brexit, after Labour unveiled a string of new policies at its conference last week.\n\nShe has announced plans to tackle a big increase in rough sleeping, to be funded by a tax on foreign-owned homes.\n\nThe Prime Minister also revealed plans for a Festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to showcase the nation in January 2022 - months before the next scheduled general election.\n\nAnd Health Secretary Matt Hancock said health officials would produce guidelines on the amount of time young people should spend on social media.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "The US and Canada have reached a new trade deal, along with Mexico, to replace the current North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).\n\nThe United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) gives the US greater access to Canada's dairy market and allows extra imports of Canadian cars.\n\nThe deal has 34 chapters and governs more than $1tn (\u00a3767bn) in trade.\n\nUS President Donald Trump, who has long sought to change Nafta, said the new deal was \"wonderful\".\n\nUntil recently it looked as if Canada could be excluded from a final trade agreement to replace Nafta which has been in place since 1994.\n\nThe new USMCA is intended to last 16 years and be reviewed every six years.\n\nFollowing the agreement, Mr Trump tweeted that USMCA was a \"great deal\" for all three countries and solves the \"deficiencies and mistakes\" in Nafta.\n\nThe US has been fighting trade wars on several fronts this year, including placing tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Mexico and Canada, as part of President Trump's America First policy. Tariffs on cars are also threatened.\n\u2022 What is a trade war and why should I worry?\n\u2022 Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win\n\u2022 Is Trump right about trade?\n\nWhat is in the new deal?\n\nThe hundreds of pages of the agreement were released in the early hours of Monday and contain updated arrangements for Canada's dairy industry and measures aimed at shifting lower-paid car jobs from Mexico.\n\u2022 On dairy, US farmers will have access to 3.5% of Canada's $16bn-a-year dairy market.\n\u2022 On cars, Canada and Mexico have a quota of 2.6 million cars they can export to the US as a protection for their car industry if the US imposes a 25% global tariff on car imports\n\u2022 In addition, 40% of car parts of vehicles produced in the USMCA area must be made in areas of North America, paying wages of $16 an hour\n\u2022 On the lumber (or wood) industry, Canada secured protection from US anti-dumping tariffs through the preservation of a dispute-settlement mechanism.\n\nHow was the deal reached?\n\nThe US made a deal with Mexico in August, but relations with Canada over the trade pact had become increasingly strained in recent weeks.\n\nThe Trump administration set Sunday as a deadline for Canada to strike a deal.\n\nA protectionist policy under the Mr Trump has seen the US forge ahead with individual trade deals, rejecting bigger multi-lateral trade agreements and posing a challenge to decades of global free trade.\n\nAs part of this policy Mr Trump has also launched a trade war against China, which has already hurt companies and could curb global economic growth.\n\u2022 US-China trade row: What has happened so far?\n\nIs this a win for President Trump? He certainly has got Canada and Mexico to agree some important things he wanted.\n\nIt will be harder, or at least more expensive, for car makers to use parts from outside North America, notably from China. American dairy farmers are getting better access to the highly protected Canadian market.\n\nThere may well be some political benefit for him in the forthcoming Congressional elections.\n\nBut he has another wider objective - to reduce the imbalance in US international trade, with individual trade partners and globally.\n\nThe US imports more than it exports and President Trump wants to change that. Judging whether he has won in that sense will need more time.\n\nHowever, many economists don't think trade balances are primarily the outcome of trade policy - instead they reflect government borrowing, private investment and savings decisions and international capital movements.\n\nWhat has been the reaction?\n\nThe Canadian dollar jumped to a five-month high and the Mexican peso rose to its highest level for seven weeks on news of the deal.\n\nMeredith Crowley, international trade economist at the University of Cambridge, said the agreement on dairy looked to be a \"cosmetic concession\" so in one way Canada had done well out of the pact.\n\nShe said the insertion of a minimum wage level for car parts workers could lead to similar clauses in other trade deals.\n\n\"If it turns out to be very politically popular in the US it could [be used again],\" she said,\n\nCanadian dairy farmers were critical. \"We fail to see how this deal can be good for the 220,000 Canadian families that depend on dairy for their livelihood,\" said Pierre Lampron, president of Dairy Farmers of Canada.\n\nHowever, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said: \"It's a good day for Canada\".\n\nMexico's Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said it was a good deal for his country and North America.\n\nThe aim is for the agreement to be signed before Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto leaves office on 1 December.",

It's got to go to the people you intended it to go to, it's got to be a transparent process, it's also got to be voluntary for good service.\"\n\u2022 making it clearer for customers that tips are optional\n\u2022 preventing or limiting any employer deduction from tips except for those required under tax law\n\u2022 and updating the existing voluntary code of practice from the government and putting it on a statutory footing to increase employer compliance\n\nMr Javid said the government would also look at legislation \"if necessary\".\n\nUnite had been campaigning for action after complaining that some firms were counting tips as part of a worker's pay.\n\nDave Turnbull, Unite's officer for the hospitality sector, said any change would need backing in law to make it effective.\n\n\"Restaurant staff and hotel staff and back-of-house staff should be paid a living wage,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"They're highly skilled people, they've got a lot of customer service skills and it shouldn't be a situation where restaurant owners and large corporate companies take it for granted that customers are going to subsidise low pay.\"\n\nBut Mr Turnbull said the proposals were a \"massive victory for all those waiting staff who have worked tirelessly to expose sharp practices in the hospitality industry\".\n\n\"All they want is what any worker wants - to take home what they have earned, no corners cut,\" he said.\n\nThe British Hospitality Association (BHA), which represents more than 40,000 establishments in the UK, said it would meet with hospitality business leaders across the UK and conduct its own impact assessment.\n\nBHA chief executive Ufi Ibrahim told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Empower the customer to know exactly what happens to tips should they choose to leave them.\n\n\"Ensure that they know they don't have to leave a service charge, that they could opt to leave a cash tip if they wish to.\n\n\"And let them know where that money is going. But what we need to do I think is to ensure that transparency is compulsory.\"\n\nFood critic Jay Rayner told the BBC that the system of service charges and tipping \"has outlived its usefulness\". He believes tipping should be scrapped, with waiters receiving a rise in their basic wage instead.\n\n\"It's a bizarre system that we have and it only applies in restaurants, pretty much,\" he said.\n\nLast year, restaurant chain Pizza Express announced it would stop deducting an 8% administration fee from staff tips made by card following pressure from unions and staff.\n\nThe firm, which uses a \"tronc\" system where tips are collected together and distributed evenly through the staff, said tips made by card would be \"fully distributed\" among employees.\n\nRestaurant chain Giraffe scrapped its 10% admin fee on tips last year, joining the Restaurant Group, Carluccio's, Garfunkel's and Jamie Oliver's which do not deduct a fee.",

That's a Democratic plan.\"\n\nBehind him, cast members remained silent, many bowing their heads and rolling their eyes. Some audience members cheered, while others booed.\n\nComedian Chris Rock, a former Saturday Night Live performer who filmed some of the speech, can be heard laughing and saying \"Oh My God\" as it continued.\n\nWest went on to suggest that Saturday Night Live had tried to stop him from making a political statement.\n\n\"They bullied me backstage. They said don't go out there with that hat on. They bullied me backstage. They bullied me.\"\n\nBut he ended his monologue by thanking the show \"even though some of y'all don't agree\".\n\nHe then posted a message on Twitter explaining why he had worn the MAGA hat.\n\n\"This represents good and America becoming whole again,\" he wrote. \"We will no longer outsource to other countries. We build factories here in America and create jobs. We will provide jobs for all who are free from prisons as we abolish the 13th amendment.\n\nThe 13th Amendment to the US Constitution, ratified after the civil war, abolished slavery and involuntary servitude.\n\nWest, who caused uproar earlier this year by referring to slavery as \"a choice\", appears to object to the amendment on the grounds that it \"allowed for prisoners to be used as slave labour,\" observed political journalist Yashar Ali.\n\n\"But he doesn't articulate that in his tweet leaving people confused and others delighted.\"\n\nWest later clarified the comments in a late-night tweet that said he wanted to \"amend not abolish\" the 13th Amendment, calling it \"slavery in disguise - meaning it never ended.\"\n\nThe star's political stance has increasingly infuriated his fellow musicians, with the likes of John Legend and Chance The Rapper criticising his support of Donald Trump.\n\nFollowing Saturday's pronouncement, producer Swizz Beats - who is married to Alicia Keys - posted a video message to Kanye, saying black musicians feel \"uncomfortable\" with him \"representing somebody that's blatantly hurting our people\".\n\n\"We love you, we're not bullying you. But you gotta stop. That [expletive] ain't right.\"\n\nQuestlove, the drummer for the Roots, the rap group who also serve as the in-house band for Jimmy Fallon's US chat show, posted Rock's video with the caption: \"I'm going to sleep. I'm done man. Done.\"\n\nCaptain America star Chris Evans also took Kanye to task, writing: \"There's nothing more maddening than debating someone who doesn't know history, doesn't read books, and frames their myopia as virtue.\n\n\"The level of unapologetic conjecture I've encountered lately isn't just frustrating, it's retrogressive, unprecedented and absolutely terrifying.\"\n\nHowever, West found one person who enjoyed his latest performance.\n\n\"Like many, I don't watch Saturday Night Live (even though I past hosted it) - no longer funny, no talent or charm,\" tweeted President Trump. \"It is just a political ad for the Dems.\n\n\"Word is that Kanye West, who put on a MAGA hat after the show (despite being told \"no\"), was great.

Amazingly, I still get recognised.

            "description": "Landlords claim that new government rules will result in an increase in rent for tenants.",
            "section": "England",
            "content": "Tenants living in shared houses in England could face eviction or increases in rent because of changes to government rules, the National Landlords Association (NLA) has warned.\n\nFrom Monday an extra 160,000 houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) have to be registered with local councils, almost triple the current figure.\n\nTenants Union UK said any increases in rent would be unfair on tenants.\n\nThe government said the new rules would raise housing standards for tenants.\n\nHMOs are homes where people, who are not related, sleep in separate rooms but share facilities such as kitchens or bathrooms.\n\nMainly students, migrants and low-paid workers live in the half a million HMO properties in England.\n\nCurrently about 64,000 of these HMOs are required to be licensed but the rule changes mean more properties will be required to be inspected and certificated by local authorities.\n\nPreviously only houses of more than three storeys and with five or more people forming at least two households had to be licensed.\n\nThe new rules remove the three-storey threshold and apply to smaller homes.\n\n'The only way I can save money'\n\nRrouse, an environmental engineer from Leeds, has been living in HMOs for the past nine years, as he tries to save money to buy a house.\n\n\"Property prices are so high, so saving for a deposit is hard work, and rents for one-bed flats are extortionate. So the only way I can afford to build a deposit is to live in a HMO,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a sociable way to rent, but the quality of the properties can vary. I've had HMOs where gas leaks have been common, carpets haven't been fitted and whole kitchen units have fallen off the wall.\"\n\nFigures from the Valuation Office Agency show that the private median rent for a room in England in 2017-18 was \u00a3385 a month.\n\nOver the past three years median room rents in England have risen twice as fast as median wages, leaving tenants like Rrouse concerned about any future increases.\n\n\"If rents do go up because of this new legislation I've got friends who'll struggle to pay their rent because they just haven't got the cash,\" he said.\n\nThe Centre for Economics and Business Research estimates the licensing process will on average cost landlords \u00a31,200 each, and collectively, more than \u00a395m.\n\nLandlords say the extra licensing costs will result in rents having to be increased.\n\nSome landlords are also expected to reduce the number of rooms they rent out, meaning existing tenants would face eviction.\n\nThe new rules, which only apply to properties in England, will also require landlords to provide extra refuse bins and make sure bedrooms within HMOs are a minimum size.\n\nWhat is an HMO and what is changing?\n\u2022 An HMO is a property occupied by more than one household and by more than two people. For a property to be classified as an HMO, the residents must be sharing at least one basic amenity (i.e. toilet, bathroom or kitchen)\n\u2022 Under the old licensing scheme HMOs that were three or more storeys and occupied by five or more people forming at least two separate households were required to be licensed\n\u2022 The new mandatory licensing of HMOs will be extended so that smaller properties (i.e. any storey height) that house five or more people in two or more separate households will also require a licence\n\nThe NLA said the new regulations though are the latest burden being placed on private sector landlords.\n\n\"Extra regulation will increase landlords costs,\" says Richard Lambert, chief executive of the NLA.\n\n\"When costs go up, like any other business, landlords will look to pass on that additional cost in the price, meaning tenants will pay more in rent.\n\n\"Some landlords will also reduce the number of rooms they rent out to try and comply with the legislation, meaning some tenants will face eviction.\"\n\nWhat are your shared housing rights?\n\nIf you live in an HMO your landlord must:\n\u2022 Keep shared areas clean and in good repair - for example staircases and corridors\n\u2022 Repair faulty gas and electrical appliances - the property has to have a gas safety check every year and the electrics must be checked every five years\n\nIf your home does not meet the safety standards you should first complain to your landlord. If the problem is not fixed then you are advised to contact your local council.\n\nThe council should inspect the property and can tell your landlord to fix the problem if it does not meet safety standards.\n\nIf the landlord still does not follow the advice, the council can take over the management of the home in serious cases, such as your health or safety being at serious risk.\n\nIf this happens, usually for a 12-month period, your tenancy rights stay the same and you pay your rent to the council.\n\nThe number of HMO licences has been increasing in recent years as more people look to rent privately.\n\nData from about 200 councils in England, obtained by a BBC Freedom of Information request, suggested the number of HMO licences has nearly trebled since 2013.\n\u2022 Can a landlord kick me out?\n\nBen Clay, from Tenants Union UK, said it would be wrong for landlords to increase rents because of the introduction of new legislation.\n\n\"Renters are already facing a perfect storm of rent increases at a time when more people are having to deal with shrinking wage packets,\" he added.\n\n\"We welcome this additional legislation, but we feel that there is still further to go and that all rented accommodation should be subject to regulation, to ensure standards rise.\"\n\nThe Ministry of Housing and Local Government said the new rules would help protect at least 850,000 more people in privately-rented homes.\n\nA spokesman said: \"While the vast majority of landlords provide decent accommodation, these measures are about raising standards in private rented homes where landlords knowingly flout their responsibilities.\n\n\"Many of the properties that will be covered by the new rules, already fall under existing licensing schemes that will be transferred into mandatory licensing free of charge, so there will be no additional costs to those landlords.\"\n\nDo you live in shared housing?

            "section": "UK Politics",
            "content": "The minister responsible for Brexit has told the EU to \"get real\" and reach a deal with the UK.\n\nDominic Raab also said EU chiefs had disrespected Theresa May with \"jibes\" at a recent summit.\n\nHe said the UK would leave without a deal rather than be \"bullied\" into signing a \"one-sided\" arrangement.\n\nMeanwhile EU figures hit back after Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt likened it to a Soviet-era prison, comments diplomats called \"insulting\".\n\nIn a speech to the Conservative conference on Sunday, Mr Hunt compared what he said were the EU's attempts to stop members leaving with the actions of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.\n\nHis words were criticised by a number of European politicians and diplomats while a European Commission spokesman suggested everyone \"could benefit from opening a history book from time to time\".\n\nSpeaking in Birmingham on Monday, Mr Raab said the government's proposed deal with the EU was not \"perfect\" but he urged Tory Eurosceptics who are campaigning for the plan to be ditched to get behind it.\n\nAnd Chancellor Philip Hammond predicted that there would be an economic bounce if and when a Brexit deal was agreed by the UK and the EU.\n\nHe reminded people saying that a deal could not be struck that people had had the same scepticism about the electric light bulb ever working.\n\nWith less than six months to go before Brexit day, the UK and the EU have not yet reached a deal on how separation will be managed and what their new relationship will look like.\n\nMr Raab said that if the EU insisted on trying to \"lock us in via the back door\" of its customs union and single market, the UK could be left with \"no choice\" but to leave without a deal.\n\nThe \"whole of the government machine is busy preparing for no deal\" - not because they want it to happen or because it's likely, but \"because it might happen\", he said.\n\nHe dismissed \"lurid predictions from the prophets of doom\" about no-deal, including planes being grounded and ports blocked.\n\nEven if the UK did not reach an agreement with the EU, he said: \"I find it hard to believe that they would, for narrow political ends, seek to punish Britain in such a crass and counterproductive way.\"\n\nMr Raab criticised the EU over its reaction to Theresa May's proposals at last month's summit in Salzburg.\n\n\"Our Prime Minister has been constructive and respectful,\" he said.\n\n\"In return we heard jibes from senior leaders, and we saw a starkly one-sided approach to negotiation.\"\n\nWhat is wrong with Chequers?\n\nBrexiteers feel it keeps the UK far too close to Brussels and doesn't fulfil the Leave campaign's promise during the 2016 referendum campaign to \"take back control\".\n\nEU leaders have rejected the plan because they believe it would undermine the single market by allowing the UK to \"cherry pick\" from EU law.\n\nTheresa May says the ball is now in the EU's court and she wants a more detailed response from them on their objections.\n\nThe government has said it will not agree to anything that divides Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK nor makes the country a member of the European Economic Area like Norway.\n\nOne of the most vocal critics of the government's Brexit approach has been former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who branded Theresa May's plan \"deranged\" in a newspaper interview at the weekend.\n\nDespite not being in Birmingham, Mr Johnson made an eye-catching appearance as he was photographed running through fields near his Oxfordshire home.\n\nGiven that Mrs May famously said her naughtiest moment was running through fields of wheat as a child, some pundits are wondering whether this was an attempt to \"troll\" the PM by the former Leave campaign frontman, who resigned in protest at the Chequers plan in July.\n\nJeremy Hunt has seemingly provoked a diplomatic row after accusing the EU of seeking to punish the UK in order to \"keep the club together\".\n\nIn Sunday's speech, he recalled a visit to Latvia earlier this summer and the role that the UK and others played in helping it transition from Soviet rule to becoming a modern democracy and market economy.\n\n\"What happened to the confidence and ideals of the European dream?\", he asked. \"The EU was set up to protect freedom. It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving.\"\n\nGuy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator, tweeted that the remarks were \"outrageous and offensive\".\n\nAlso on the conference stage on Monday, Mr Hammond warned that slow wage growth and job insecurity meant too many people feared they were being left behind.\n\nHe announced the government's intention to increase the number of people who can access science and technology courses and spend about \u00a330m on encouraging big business to mentor small firms.\n\u2022 Theresa May: 'I do believe in Brexit'\n\nHis plans also included a \u00a3125m package allowing large employers to transfer up to 25% of their apprenticeship levy funds to businesses in their supply chain from April next year.\n\nThe apprenticeship levy is a tax on large companies intended to pay for training at smaller companies, but uptake of the new policy has been slow.\n\nMr Hammond rejected suggestions that Brexit had caused an irreparable rift between his party and business, telling activists the Conservatives were and \"always will be the party of business\".",

Tesco Bank said all the money had been refunded to account holders.\n\nIt added it was \"very sorry\" for the impact the attack had had on customers.\n\n'Too little, too late'\n\nThe FCA said that the attack had been largely avoidable and that Tesco had not responded to it with sufficient rigour, skill nor urgency.\n\nMark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said the regulator would not put up with such behaviour.\n\n\"The fine the FCA imposed on Tesco Bank today reflects the fact that the FCA has no tolerance for banks that fail to protect customers from foreseeable risks,\" he said.\n\n\"In this case, the attack was the subject of a very specific warning that Tesco Bank did not properly address until after the attack started. This was too little, too late. Customers should not have been exposed to the risk at all.\"\n\nThe FCA said cyber attackers had exploited deficiencies in Tesco Bank's design of its debit card, its financial crime controls and in its financial crime operations team.\n\nTesco Bank said it been the victim of a \"sophisticated criminal fraud\".\n\nWhile it did not lead to the theft or loss of any customers' data, there were 34 transactions where funds were debited from customers' accounts. The bank added that other customers had their normal service disrupted.\n\nGerry Mallon, Tesco Bank's chief executive, said:-\"We are very sorry for the impact that this fraud attack had on our customers. Our priority is always the safety and security of our customers' accounts and we fully accept the FCA's notice.\n\n\"We have significantly enhanced our security measures to ensure that our customers' accounts have the highest levels of protection. I apologise to our customers for the inconvenience caused in 2016.\"\n\nTesco Bank's co-operation with the FCA's inquiry, and its agreement to an early settlement, meant the fine was reduced from \u00a333.6m.",

But this is a very detailed and complex negotiation.\n\n\"It doesn't require big sweeping statements, it requires meticulous attention to the negotiation strategy.\n\n\"Hundreds of civil servants are working round the clock on negotiating this package with the European Union and it requires that level of attention to detail.\"\n\nThe chancellor also said he would be revealing more about proposed tax rises to pay for extra NHS spending at the Budget, which takes place on 29 October.\n\u2022 No deal? EU may leave UK with 'no choice'\n\nFor Labour, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the chancellor's speech \"confirmed the bankrupt state of the Tory party, increasingly irrelevant and cut off from the real day to day life most people experience\".\n\nHe added: \"As the Tories sink into a pit of bitter infighting, we mustn't allow them to take the country down with it.\"\n\nOn Saturday former Brexit minister Steve Baker attacked the Confederation of British Industry - which has warned about the prospects of the UK leaving the EU without a deal - calling them a \"grave menace to the political stability and economic prospects of the UK\".\n\nCBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn responded by saying they represented 190,000 businesses and warning that \"shooting the messenger gets the country nowhere\".\n\nMs Fairbairn was happier with the messages in Mr Hammond's speech, saying: \"Pride and confidence in British business has for too long been missing in Westminster. It made a comeback in the chancellor's speech today.\"\n\nAnd on the main stage at the Tory conference on Sunday, the businessman and peer Lord Digby Jones - who was part of the Leave campaign and a former CBI chief - said reports Mr Johnson had used the f-word when referring to businesses' Brexit concerns \"showed him up for the irrelevant and offensive person he really is\".\n\nMeanwhile City grandee Michael Spencer, a long-standing Tory donor, told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that the party have \"lost their way\" and the PM had \"let herself down\" by failing to champion business.",

The scan on Friday confirmed a fracture of the right eye-socket and an explosion of the eyeball.\"\n\u2022 Why a WhatsApp 'love-in' was key to Europe's triumph\n\nMrs Remande also criticised the Paris tournament organisers for \"not making contact\" after the incident to find out how she was. She also claims there was \"no warning shout from the course official when the ball was heading towards the crowd\".\n\nA Ryder Cup spokesperson told the BBC: \"It is distressing to hear that someone might suffer long-term consequences from a ball strike.\n\n\"We have been in communication with the family involved, starting with the immediate on-course treatment and thereafter to provide support, helping with the logistics of repatriation, including providing a transfer for the family from Paris to Lyon. We will continue to offer support for as long as necessary.\n\n\"Ball strikes are an occasional hazard for spectators but this kind of incident is extremely rare.\n\n\"We can confirm that 'fore' was shouted several times but also appreciate how hard it can be to know when and where every ball is struck if you are in the crowd.\n\n\"We are hugely sympathetic and will do everything we can to support the spectator, insofar as that is possible under very difficult circumstances.\"\n\nMrs Remande did praise three-time major winner Koepka, who went over to see how she was. She said she downplayed the incident so that the golfer \"would stay concentrated\".\n\n\"It looked like it hurt,\" the 28-year-old said afterwards.\n\nHe added: \"It's hard to control a golf ball, especially for 300 yards, and a lot of times the fans are close to the fairway.\n\n\"You can yell 'fore' but it doesn't matter from 300 yards, you can't hear it.\"\n\nEurope's winning Ryder Cup captain Thomas Bjorn said: \"It's terrible, it's a freak accident that's happened, and all our thoughts are with her.\"\n\nThere are an average 12,400 golf-related injuries which require hospital treatment each year in the UK alone, according to specialist insurance company Golf Care.\n\nSpectating at golf tournaments can be a hazardous business. Top players are not as precise as you might expect and errant tee shots occasionally have nowhere to go other than into packed galleries.\n\nThese misdirected missiles have the speed to do plenty of damage but more often than not injuries are limited to cuts and bruises. Players usually offer a signed glove to the victim, as if that will ease the pain.\n\nIn more serious incidents, injuries can be very unsettling for the players involved. The majority sound a warning cry of \"fore\" but there are some who appear content to allow fans to be a barrier to prevent their balls from flying into deeper trouble and remain silent in the wake of wayward blows.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles a different business leader from around the world. This week we speak to Ben Francis, founder of UK sportswear brand Gymshark.\n\nIt is hard to know how a then 19-year-old Ben Francis had the time or the energy to get Gymshark up and running.\n\nWhile many young entrepreneurs have to juggle running their start-up with holding down a nine to five job, back in 2012 Ben was a full-time student by day, and a pizza delivery man by night.\n\n\"I'd wake up and go to Aston University [in Birmingham], then finish uni early afternoon, and work at Pizza Hut from 5pm till 10pm,\" he says.\n\n\"I could answer emails [about Gymshark] in between deliveries. Then I'd go home and sort out the website, and design new products.\"\n\nAfter two exhausting years of this - with annual revenues of his nascent business hitting an impressive \u00a3250,000 - Ben quit both university and the world of pizzas to focus on his company.\n\nFast-forward to today, and Gymshark expects turnover this year to reach \u00a3100m.\n\nBefore Ben set up the business in 2012 it is fair to say that the entrepreneurial fire was already burning in his belly.\n\nAs a young teenager he set up a website that sold car licence plates. A keen gym-goer, he then built and launched two iPhone fitness tracking apps, one of which earned him around \u00a38,000.\n\nThe idea for Gymshark followed; an online retail business aimed at fitness fanatics that originally sold health supplements.\n\n\"I was going to the gym and basically was interested in, and wanted to be involved in, the fitness industry,\" he says. \"I wanted to combine that with making a transactional website.\"\n\nWhen Ben found that the profit margins from selling the supplements were too low, he dived into another area - clothing.\n\n\"I remember looking around, and I couldn't find any clothing I wanted to wear,\" he says. \"So I said, 'let's make it ourselves.'\"\n\nEnlisting the help of his brother, and a group of friends, Ben bought a sewing machine and screen printer, and started to make gym vests and t-shirts in his parents' garage.\n\n\"My nan made curtains, so she taught me how to sew,\" he says. \"I remember thinking we had 10 orders to do, and to make 12-15 products it would take most of the day. But it was so much fun learning.\"\n\nNow 26, Ben admits that after Gymshark first moved into clothing there was no immediate grand plan regarding growing the business. \"It was more a case of 'I really want to wear this,' so I made it,\" he says.\n\nAnd so the company started to make body builder vests that fitted slim teenagers, because most on the market were designed for older men who had already built up their muscle bulk.\n\nBen adds that he would also guess on how much to price items. \"It was literally a case of what would we want to pay for something,\" he says.\n\n\"There was no considered approach. We were like, 'we would pay \u00a320.'\"\n\nSix years later, Gymshark now has more than 1.2 million customers, and 215 employees at its Solihull headquarters in the West Midlands.\n\nSo how has the firm been able to grow so quickly? In short, it has been a very savvy user of social media.\n\nMore specifically Gymshark decided it would send free clothing to key \"influencers\", prominent body-builders and other fitness fanatics - such as Lex Griffin and Nikki Blackketter.\n\nThe hope was that such stars would talk positively about the products to their followers on YouTube and Instagram.\n\nThe idea worked better than Gymshark could have dreamed, and sales soon skyrocketed.\n\nAt the same time it worked hard to ensure its own social media accounts were as interesting and visual as possible. Today it has 2.4 million followers on Instagram and 1.5 million on Facebook.\n\nMore The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world:\n\u2022 'They were not comfortable about hiring a woman'\n\u2022 'People thought we were interns but we were in charge'\n\u2022 The dad who feeds his son burgers almost every day\n\nMore recently the firm has held events around the world, inviting fans of the brand to meet some of its influencers. Hundreds of people typically attend.\n\nAnother key factor in the continuing success of Gymshark is bringing in a more experienced pair of hands to help Ben run the business. Sportswear industry veteran Steve Hewitt joined as managing director in 2015, before being given the chief executive title in April last year.\n\nBen remains the majority owner, with Mr Hewitt and chief strategic officer Paul Richardson also having substantial stakes. Another shareholder is Ben's friend Lewis Morgan who helped to launch Gymshark, but left the business a few years ago.\n\nEmily Sutherland, a features writer at trade magazine Drapers, says Gymshark's use of social media influencers has been key to its success.\n\n\"The influencers give shoppers a reason to buy into Gymshark over other brands, because they feel a personal connection,\" she says.\n\nMs Sutherland adds that because Gymshark is an online-only and direct-to-consumer brand, it is \"able to remain nimble, react quickly to market changes, and isn't weighed down by expensive store costs\".\n\nAs for the future, the plan is to expand Gymshark's overseas sales. Already 40% of its sales come from the US, and it aims to have 25 international country-specific online stores by 2020, up from 11 at present.\n\nThe company may also open its first bricks-and-mortar store.\n\n\"I don't go shopping very often, but I'm thinking of the best way to do a permanent location somewhere,\" says Ben. \"I'm not sure, we'd need a lot of space. I want to do a cool destination.\"",

            "description": "Britons spend very little on food compared with other nations, but that could be about to change.",
            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Many Britons feel they have to watch the pennies after recent inflation rises and years of flatlining wages.\n\nThis extends to their supermarket shop, with four in 10 people reporting they are concerned about the cost of food.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, grocery giant Tesco has joined the discount retailers, which the launch of \"value-orientated\" chain Jack's.\n\nYet in relative terms, the British grocery shop remains one of the cheapest in the world.\n\nBritons spend an average of 8% of their total household expenditure on food to eat at home. This is less than any other country apart from the US and Singapore, according to data from market research firm Euromonitor.\n\nFood spending varies considerably around the world. Greeks spend 16%, while Peruvians spend 26%. Nigerians spend the most on food in relative terms - 59% of their household budget.\n\nThe food consumed in the UK is also the cheapest in Western Europe - costing 8% less than the EU average, according to EU statistical body Eurostat.\n\nIt is also much cheaper in relative terms than the food bought by Britons' parents and grandparents.\n\nThe proportion of household income spent on food has more than halved over the past 60 years, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), while spending on housing costs and leisure activities has doubled.\n\nWhy have Britons come to spend less and less of their income on food?\n\nIt's partly a reflection of how people shop.\n\nStore loyalty has decreased over time, with consumers more likely to shop around for the best prices.\n\nFour out of 10 would not care if their usual supermarket closed, one survey of 1,500 of UK consumers found. Almost one in five had switched from their main supermarket in the past year.\n\nOver the decades the traditional single weekly shopping trip has also given way to more frequent outings, for purchasing smaller baskets of goods.\n\nUnable to rely on past loyalty, supermarkets have had to work harder to attract customers.\n\nThis is particularly true now there are more low-cost options available. Discounters Aldi and Lidl have grown quickly in recent years and now have 13% of the UK's grocery market, making it much harder for other supermarkets to raise their prices.\n\nAs with many countries, the UK has benefitted from mostly rising incomes, while food production has become more efficient.\n\nFarming has become increasingly mechanised, which speeds up production and helps to maximise harvests.\n\nAt the same time, the way food is transported, stored and distributed has become increasingly streamlined. All of this has helped to push down the price of groceries in the shops.\n\nThe UK has also benefitted from the growth of trade between countries. It currently imports about half of all its food, up from a third in 1988.\n\nRetailers are able to source foods cheaply from around the world, without incurring the UK's often higher manufacturing and processing costs.\n\nMore like this\n\u2022 Who are the children hoping to earn \u00a324 an hour?\n\u2022 What British people think about Brexit now\n\u2022 How housing has divided the young\n\nHowever, we cannot be certain that the era of ultra-low food prices will continue.\n\nOne threat comes from the weather.\n\nThis year, the Beast from the East brought snow and low temperatures in March and was followed by a summer heatwave. The combination hit crop yields and has already led to increased prices.\n\nThis combination caused the wholesale cost of carrots to rise by 80% and wheat by 20% between March and July, consultancy CEBR estimated. It believes these and other price rises could add \u00a37 on to household bills every month.\n\nWhile episodes like this may still be relatively rare in the UK, most scientists agree that international weather patterns are becoming more extreme.\n\nIf droughts and floods become more frequent, this is likely to boost global food prices.\n\nThe UK's reliance on imported food means it is particularly affected by changes in the strength of the pound.\n\nSince the Brexit referendum in June 2016, the pound has fallen by as much as 17% against the euro and 29% against the dollar, although it has recovered somewhat since then.\n\nThis has been followed by trade disputes, as food suppliers seek to pass a portion of their rising import costs on to retailers. One example of this was \"Marmitegate\", when Tesco temporarily stopped stocking Unilever products after the manufacturer raised its prices.\n\nThere are also fears that prices could rise if supplies are disrupted immediately after Brexit and duties are increased on EU imports, which account for about 30% of the food eaten in the UK.\n\nIf there is a \"no-deal\" Brexit, the UK should expect to see \"a pretty significant increase in the cost of fruit and veg, the cost of meat and the cost of dairy products\", according to Lord Price, former Conservative trade minister and ex-boss of Waitrose.\n\nHowever, we do not yet know what the impact of Brexit will be on food prices. Another suggestion is that duties on food imported from outside of the EU will be lowered and that the UK will start to grow more at home.\n\nThe UK is also subject to global trends beyond its control. By 2050, the world's population is predicted to increase by a third, with almost 10 billion mouths to feed.\n\nThe growing middle class in countries like China now has more disposable income to spend on food, beyond the essentials.\n\nThis includes eating more meat and dairy products. Such trends can lead to price rises if demand can't keep up, for example the 24% spike in the price of butter.\n\nIn January 2017, cold weather in Italy and heavy rainfall in Spain caused a \"perfect storm\" for courgette importers, pushing up prices at a time of year when Western consumers demand healthier food.\n\nWe are in an era of low food prices, compared with other countries and the UK's own history.\n\nIf this changes, Britons may have to think hard about the choices they make.\n\nPublic health could improve if price rises lead people to consume fewer calories. But it could also lead to worsening diets if fresh produce prices rise faster than those of processed food.\n\nEither way, environmental and economic factors may mean UK consumers face a future of higher food prices.\n\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from experts working for an outside organisation.\n\nRatula Chakraborty is a professor of Business Management at Norwich Business School, University of East Anglia\n\nPaul Dobson is a professor of Business Strategy and Public Policy and head of Norwich Business School, University of East Anglia",

No one was given any plans, and everyone was just asked to leave...a horrible experience. Nickolaus Lachman\n\nThe airline said it had failed to secure long-term financing, meaning it had \"no choice\" but to file for bankruptcy.\n\nPrimera's decision to start competing with other low-cost long-haul operators such as Norwegian and Wow appears to have led to its demise.\n\nSigns that the airline was in trouble came in August, when it said short-haul flights from Birmingham to seven European destinations would end on 3 September.\n\nIt also blamed the late arrival of new aircraft from Airbus that forced it to cancel flights and lease planes.\n\nWhen it began long-haul operations from Stansted in May, Primera was offering flights to New York's Newark airport, Boston, Washington DC and Toronto starting at \u00a3149 each way.\n\nIt had planned to start flying from Madrid to New York, Boston and Toronto next month from \u20ac149 each way.\n\n\"The general feeling in the industry was: this airline is travelling a bit too fast in terms of their expansion with a fleet of that size,\" he said.",

Why wouldn't they?\" she said.\n\nPret a Manger chief executive Clive Schlee promised \"meaningful change\" in the wake of the coroner's findings.\n\u2022 Can lessons be learned from Pret baguette allergy death?\n\nBeatrice, whose real identity the BBC has agreed not to disclose, was in hospital for 12 hours when she suffered an allergic reaction after eating a cheese sandwich from Pret.\n\nLike Ms Ednan-Laperouse, she is allergic to sesame seeds.\n\n\"Unbeknown to me [the sandwich] contained sesame seeds,\" she told the BBC. \"They weren't visible or labelled.\"\n\nShe was at work when she felt the reaction coming on.\n\n\"I took anti-histamines and went straight to hospital. I told staff there I would go into anaphylactic shock in 10 minutes,\" she said.\n\n\"It was the worst I've ever had. I was held upside down, put on oxygen and had more shots than I've ever had in my life.\"\n\nAfter posting a photo from her hospital bed detailing the incident on social media, Beatrice was contacted by the company's \"apologetic\" managing director.\n\nShe told him: \"You need to stick labels on your food before you kill someone.\"\n\nThe executive offered her a voucher, she says, but Beatrice was more interested in the labelling.\n\n\"I didn't do it to get money. I wanted to see a change,\" she told the BBC.\n\nShe was told that a pilot was coming up in December 2017 or early 2018, in which stickers would be added to all packaging.\n\n\"They're taking unnecessary risks. It's not a viable business model when your company ends up in the media when someone eats your sandwich and dies.\"\n\nAmelia Zekavica, a law student aged 20, is allergic to nuts, pulses, sesame seeds and \"almost anything furry\" she told the BBC.\n\nShe described how when she was 18 years old, she fell ill within five minutes of eating a Chicken Caesar sandwich from Pret.\n\n\"I was quite scared. It's so terrifying when you have these kinds of allergies. It's like your own body is just killing itself.\"\n\nHer mother made her vomit and gave her some anti-histamine tablets to get the swelling down from her lips and throat.\n\nAt home, Amelia rested while her mother called the store to ask about the ingredients. Her father Milan recalled what happened next:\n\n\"Pret were no help whatsoever. They told my wife everything was online.\n\n\"We went on their website and found there was sesame in the Caesar dressing but this was not indicated on the packaging or in store.\"\n\nAmelia became progressively unwell and spent four hours in A&E. \"Luckily she shook it off,\" said Milan.\n\nThis is not the first time Amelia has had a bad allergic reaction.\n\n\"I'm always very careful. Each reaction is different and they can get progressively worse.\n\n\"When my mum and dad told me about the girl who'd died, it really struck a chord. The food industry should understand that there are people out there who have allergies.\n\n\"People can die. This is not stressed enough. Celiac awareness is stressed a lot - it's also bad but they don't die from it.\n\n\"The food industry needs to list all of the ingredients on the packaging. You shouldn't have to check online or ask for an ingredients book. Everything should be labelled.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Pret a Manger said: \"We are very sorry for Amelia's experience and we would like to invite her and her family to get back in touch so we can give them the apology they deserve.\"\n\nMr Schlee, who joined Pret as CEO in 2003, said the company was \"deeply sorry for Natasha's death\".\n\n\"We cannot begin to comprehend the pain the family have felt and the grief they will continue to feel.\n\n\"We've listened to everything the coroner and Natasha's family have said this week and we will learn from it.\n\n\"All of us at Pret want meaningful change to come from this tragedy. We will ensure it does.\"",

            "content": "A picture of large-scale destruction is emerging in and around the Indonesian city of Palu after an earthquake and tsunami struck on Friday.\n\nAt least 844 people are confirmed to have died but that figure is expected to rise sharply as more remote areas are reached.\n\nThe authorities have said they will begin burying victims in mass graves, fearing disease could begin to spread.\n\nDozens of people are thought to be trapped alive under the rubble.\n\nIn Palu, rescuers are awaiting heavy machinery to search the ruins of a hotel and a shopping centre as aftershocks made it unsafe for them to go in.\n\n\"Communication is limited, heavy machinery is limited... it's not enough for the numbers of buildings that collapsed,\" said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency.\n\nA tsunami warning had been issued after the magnitude-7.5 earthquake hit on Friday, but it is unclear whether it was still in place when the waves hit.\n\nVideos show people screaming as 6m-high waves power over the beach - where a festival was being set-up - sweeping up everything in their path.\n\nIndonesian President Joko Widodo visited the region to urge a \"day and night\" effort to rescue survivors.\n\nMr Widodo has also agreed to accept international help for disaster response and relief, Thomas Lembong, the head of the Indonesian investment board said on Twitter on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, Indonesia's justice ministry is reporting that 1,200 convicts escaped from three different detention facilities in the Sulawesi region following the earthquake and tsunami.\n\nLying on a stretcher in the dark outside the Mamboro health clinic in Palu is a five-year-old girl with a broken leg. She was found alone, Doctor Sasono tells me. \"We don't know where her family is and she doesn't remember where they live.\" His clinic has no power and is running out of medical supplies.\n\nA few metres from her stretcher bed are rows of bodies in bags. The smell of decomposition fills the air. Dr Sasono says they will be buried in mass graves to stop the spread of diseases: \"They are starting to smell. We want to wait for relatives to pick them up, but we can't wait any longer.\"\n\nRows of rubble lie all along the shoreline where vibrant fishing villages once stood.\n\nPeople's possessions lie smashed together, with cars and boats tossed around by the massive waves. Amid the rubble are tents where families are sleeping out in the open.\n\u2022 Read Rebecca's first full report from the disaster zone\n\nHow difficult is the rescue work?\n\nBlocked roads, a damaged airport and broken telecommunications have made it difficult to bring help into the affected area, and impossible to contact more remote regions.\n\n\"We don't know for sure what is the impact,\" said Mr Nugroho.\n\nLocal media report that mobile phone signals have been detected in the rubble of the shopping mall in Palu, and shouts have been heard under the debris of the Roa Roa Hotel.\n\nOne volunteer, Thalib Bawano, told AFP news agency that three people had been rescued from the hotel rubble, where more than 50 people may be trapped.\n\n\"We also heard voices at several points, including a child,\" he said.\n\n\"They were asking for help, but they are still there till now. We gave them motivation... so they can have spirit because they are trapped between life and death.\"\n\n\"We gave them water and food but that's not what they wanted. They wanted to get out. 'We want to get out, out, out. Help! Help!' they kept screaming. That's what we heard. Some were just knocking.\"\n\nWhat are the other challenges?\n\nIn Palu, people have been sleeping in the open, wary of returning to their homes, even if they are still intact.\n\nWith hospitals damaged, injured people have been treated in the open and at least one military field hospital has been set up.\n\nThe military has taken over the airport to fly aid in, and injured people and other evacuees out.\n\n\"What you'll see, you know, as the days go by and people don't have access to adequate hygiene supplies, shelter, you'll see the situation deteriorate if they don't get that access so, we've sent shelter kits,\" Tom Howells, programme director for Save The Children, said on Sunday.\n\nWith supplies limited, people have been raiding damaged shops for food, water and medicine.\n\n\"We don't have any other choice, we must get food,\" one man told AFP.\n\nMeanwhile mass graves are being dug, one of them for up to 300 bodies.\n\nWhy was the tsunami so destructive?\n\nThe 7.5-magnitude quake occurred at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles) just off the central island of Sulawesi at 18:03 (10:03 GMT) on Friday, setting off a tsunami, US monitors say.\n\nThe earthquake was powerful but shallow and with more lateral than vertical movement, not typically the kind of tremor that sets off tsunamis.\n\nVice-President Jusuf Kalla has said the final death toll could be in the thousands while the Red Cross estimates that more than 1.6 million people have been affected.\n\nA sophisticated tsunami warning system was put in place across the whole Pacific region after the 2004 disaster, which killed nearly a quarter of a million people.\n\nIt remains unclear why it was not effective this time, but Mr Nugroho said Indonesia's part of the network has suffered from a lack of funding.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Restaurants will be legally barred from keeping tips from staff under plans to be announced by Theresa May on Monday.\n\nThe move follows a public outcry in 2015, when it emerged that many High Street chains routinely took up to 10% of tips paid by credit and debit card.\n\nMost chains have since stopped this practice, typically charging a much lower fee of 2.5% on tips paid by card.\n\nThe hospitality trade body said the fact restaurants had acted voluntarily meant new legislation was unnecessary.\n\n\"We developed a Code of Practice - together with Unite - which deals with the fair distribution of tips among all staff, not just waiters,\" said UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls.\n\n\"As a result, best practice has been promoted across the sector and we see no evidence of tips being withheld across restaurant chains.\"\n\nMs Nicholls also said smaller restaurants may need to retain \"a small amount\" from card tips to cover \"the not inconsiderable costs of credit card charges and processing payments\".\n\nMrs May said the \"tough\" legislation, which would apply in England, Scotland and Wales, was part of the government's push to end exploitative employment practices.\n\nIn 2016, Sajid Javid, then Business Secretary, said tips should go in full to waiting staff and announced proposals to stop employer deductions from them, but stopped short of legislating.\n\nA government spokesperson was unable to say whether the legislation would also cover the common practice of customer tips left for waiting staff being redistributed to include back of house staff such as cooks and kitchen workers.\n\nCharles Archer, a part-time waiter at Pizza Express in Exeter, said he retained all his cash tips. With card tips, he keeps 70% with 30% going to kitchen staff, but there is no admin fee.\n\nHe said he relied on tip money to pay for food with his basic salary used to pay his rent.\n\n\"Over the course of a week it can add up to a decent amount of money,\" he says.\n\nHe said he did not expect the proposed legislation to change the situation of tips being shared with all restaurant staff unless the law specifically stated that tips had to go to the person that served them.\n\n\"Any law creating an increase in benefits [to waiters] will reduce benefits elsewhere,\" he said.\n\n\"These companies should be paying their staff more but they don't.\"\n\nA restaurant owner, who runs four restaurants, but did not want to be named, said he welcomed the legislation because diners expected their tips to go to people who served them, not the restaurant.\n\nBut he said service tips should be shared with kitchen staff, \"otherwise, someone front-of-house who's just started could be earning more than an experienced trained chef\".\n\nHe said that some waiters on minimum wage would earn up to \u00a315 an hour with tips, a rate he could not match for kitchen staff.\n\nReality Check: Where does my tip go now?\n\nDo you leave a tip in cash or pay it by card? It might make a difference to whether it ends up in the pocket of your server or is kept by the business.\n\nCash tips are legally the property of staff. They can go straight to the person serving you or they can be pooled and shared out among staff - but they are not the property of the business.\n\nCard tips are different - they currently belong to the owner of the restaurant who has no legal duty to hand any of them over to staff (although in practice many do).\n\nThe same applies to any service charge automatically added to a bill.\n\nHow businesses decide to share these tips out varies widely. Some keep all the tips while some skim a percentage off the top.\n\nOthers take a percentage to distribute to back of house staff.\n\nThere are about 150,000 hotels, pubs and restaurants in the UK, employing about two million people.\n\nUnite regional officer Dave Turnbull said cracking down on tipping abuses was long overdue and the union would seek assurances that the legislation truly delivered fair tips.\n\n\"There will be question marks as to whether it will deal with the myriad of scams some restaurants use to pilfer staff tips to boost their profits,\" he said.\n\nLabour said the government's proposal copied another of its policies, which the party announced in June.\n\nJeremy Corbyn had said then that a Labour government would legislate to ensure workers keep 100% of their tips.",

He has described him as a \"guardian angel\".\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, was at the control tower of Palu airport as Mr Mafella's Batik Airways plane was on the runway.\n\n\"I was rushing to leave. There was a voice in my head that told me, just get out of here immediately,\" said Mr Mafella, 44. \"I told my crew and the ground crew to speed up.\"\n\nAt 18:02, the plane took off. Less than a minute later, the 7.5 magnitude quake struck.\n\nAs the control tower started to shake, people around Mr Agung fled, but he watched to make sure the plane was airborne.\n\nHis last words were \"Batik 6321 clear for take off\".\n\nThen, apparently finding his way out blocked, he jumped from the crumbling tower. He died while awaiting treatment.\n\nMr Mafella and the 147 passengers and crew on the flight had no idea what had just happened on the ground.\n\nBut from the cockpit, Mr Mafella saw huge waves at the coastline.\n\n\"I saw it was a wave moving in a circle with a huge radius, it was getting bigger and bigger but I didn't know what it was,\" Mr Mafella told the BBC.\n\n\"I tried calling the air traffic controller a few times to tell him that I saw something, but there was no answer.\"\n\u2022 Aerial shots of debris and survival after tsunami\n\nMr Mafella only found out later why his calls went unanswered.\n\n\"I'm in a WhatsApp group with other air traffic controllers and one of them told me that they had asked Agung to get away from the tower,\" said Mr Mafella. \"But he said wait, wait, Batik [Air] is still here.\"\n\n\"When I found out what happened, I was speechless.\n\nAt least 1,000 people are now known to have died in the quake and tsunami. Officials fear that number is expected to rise.\n\nAid agencies say more than a million people have been affected.\n\nYohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, told news outlet ABC Mr Agung's decision had potentially saved hundreds of others.\n\nHe has been posthumously promoted by two levels \"as a form of appreciation for his outstanding dedication towards the deceased\" said the organisation.\n\n\"Agung dedicated himself to his job until the end of his life and did not leave the control tower until the plane took off,\" Didiet KS Radityo, the corporate secretary for Air Navigation Indonesia, told the Jakarta Post.\n\nThe organisation also showed soldiers carrying his body as it was transported for burial.\n\nThe tale of his sacrifice quickly spread online, where he was hailed a hero.\n\n\"I feel so deeply sorry,\" Mr Mafella told the BBC.\n\n\"I could have died as well. He is my hero and our national hero.\"",

The judge denies drinking to the point of memory loss.\n\nThe matter forms part of an FBI inquiry into the judge, as do allegations of sexual assault, which he also denies.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he had not limited the inquiry's scope.\n\nThe FBI inquiry has delayed a final vote on Judge Kavanaugh, who if confirmed is likely to make America's highest court more conservative.\n\nRachel Mitchell, the Arizona prosecutor hired by Republicans to question one of the judge's accusers, Prof Christine Blasey Ford, during hearings last week, gave her memo to senators on Sunday.\n\nIn it, she questioned Prof Ford's credibility, calling her case weak and saying she did not think \"that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the Committee\".\n\nWhat did the classmate say about Judge Kavanaugh?\n\nProf Ludington, who teaches at North Carolina State University, said he had seen Judge Kavanaugh slurring his words and staggering after excessive alcohol consumption while at Yale.\n\nThe professor also said Judge Kavanaugh \"was often belligerent and aggressive\" when drunk.\n\n\"I can unequivocally say that in denying the possibility that he ever blacked out from drinking, and in downplaying the degree and frequency of his drinking, Brett has not told the truth.\"\n\u2022 What will the FBI inquiry actually do?\n\u2022 Why US top court is more political than UK's\n\nHe noted that it was not Judge Kavanaugh's drinking habits in college that worried him - it was the fact that he made questionable statements under oath.\n\n\"If he lied about his past actions on national television, and more especially while speaking under oath in front of the United States Senate, I believe those lies should have consequences,\" Prof Ludington said.\n\nThe professor plans to speak to the FBI on Monday, according to the New York Times.\n\nHis statement contradicts another Yale classmate - former NBA player Chris Dudley - who told the Washington Post he \"never, ever saw Brett Kavanaugh black out\" from alcohol consumption.\n\nWhen asked about Judge Kavanaugh's drinking habits during a news conference on Monday, Mr Trump said he thought his answers during the hearing were \"excellent\".\n\n\"He had a little bit of difficulty, he talked about things that happened when he drank,\" Mr Trump said. \"This is not a man who said that he was perfect with respect to alcohol.\"\n\nThe president's son, Donald Trump Jr, has said the #MeToo movement makes him more worried about his sons' future than his daughters'.\n\n\"I've got boys. I've got girls,\" Mr Trump Jr told Daily Mail TV. \"And when I see what's going on it's scary.\"\n\nHe added that sexual assault victims should feel \"able to come out and be believed\" with the caveat: \"There has to be some credibility behind it.\"\n\nHow teens are talking about sex in the #MeToo age\n\nThere was considerable confusion last Friday, when Donald Trump ordered a reopened investigation into the \"credible allegations\" against Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nIn comments on Monday, the president did little to clear things up.\n\nWhat Mr Trump was clear about, however, was that while Judge Kavanaugh may have had \"difficulty as a young man\" with alcohol, that alone shouldn't disqualify him from the high court.\n\nNobody, the president said, has questioned how the judge has behaved \"in the last 20 years\".\n\nMr Trump's answer was a direct response to Democrats who have suggested that Judge Kavanaugh was less than forthcoming in his testimony under oath about his alcohol use while in high school and college.\n\nWith the FBI delving into Judge Kavanaugh's background - including receiving a statement from a Yale classmate who says he misrepresented the extent of his alcohol use - there's the chance more details will emerge about Judge Kavanaugh's past actions.\n\nWith his comments, the president is constructing a line of defence to keep undecided Senate Republicans - the votes necessary to confirm Judge Kavanaugh - from turning against the nominee when the final FBI report comes in.\n\nWhat is the FBI investigating?\n\nJudge Kavanaugh's behaviour at Yale is under the spotlight, with Prof Ludington and Mr Dudley among several of his classmates who have recently spoken out.\n\nThe FBI inquiry is expected to be completed within a week.\n\nIn terms of the sexual assault allegations, US media report that the FBI spoke on Sunday to another of the accusers, Deborah Ramirez.\n\nOpposition Democrats have accused the administration of trying to limit the scope of the inquiry, amid media reports that Judge Kavanaugh's third accuser - Julie Swetnick - would not be interviewed.\n\nMr Trump has denied imposing any restrictions, saying he wanted the FBI \"to interview whoever they deem appropriate\".\n\nDespite this, NBC News quoted a White House official as saying restrictions remained in place, adding that as the FBI was carrying out a background - not a criminal - investigation, the White House decided the parameters of the investigation.\n\nThe most senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, has sent a letter urging the White House to release the written directive sent by President Trump to the FBI launching the investigation.\n\nAlthough the committee on Friday approved Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, it was conditional on a new inquiry into what it said were the \"credible allegations\" facing him.\n\u2022 Ford's testimony through the eyes of a survivor\n\nAs the investigation is not a criminal one, the FBI will not say whether it believes the allegations are true.\n\nPsychology professor Christine Blasey Ford was the first woman to come forward. She testified at a hearing last week that Judge Kavanaugh tried to remove her clothing, pinned her to a bed and covered her mouth at a house party in 1982, when she was 15 and he was 17.\n\nIn response to her testimony, Judge Kavanaugh said he had never assaulted her or anyone else. He accused Democrats of politicising the process and harming his family and good name.\n\nDeborah Ramirez attended Yale at the same time as Judge Kavanaugh. She says he exposed his genitals to her during a college drinking game.\n\nJulie Swetnick says she went to house parties attended by Judge Kavanaugh in the early 1980s, where she said he and his friends had tried to \"spike\" girls' drinks.\n\nHe has denied all the accusations.",

I knew she was going to die,\" he said.\n\nNatasha, from Fulham, west London, ate an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette and became ill after buying it at Terminal 5 early on 17 July 2016.\n\nMr Ednan-Laperouse said halfway through the British Airways flight, she became severely allergic in reaction to sesame seeds contained in the sandwich, before dying later on the same day.\n\n\"Her whole body was covered in huge raised red welts - rather like as if she had been stung by hundreds of jellyfish,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\n\"That was the first time I had ever seen something like that - so it was clear to me it was a very very powerful allergenic reaction.\n\n\"She was feeling very unwell and then started having big difficulties in breathing.\"\n\nThe inquest into her death heard that sesame was not listed as an ingredient on the baguette's packaging.\n\u2022 Can lessons be learned from Pret baguette death?\n\nMr Ednan-Laperouse said he injected his daughter with adrenaline from two EpiPens as she became unwell, but unfortunately they did not work.\n\nHe added: \"Natasha said that she still couldn't breathe and desperately looked at me, she said: 'Daddy, help me, I can't breathe'.\n\n\"Those were her last words.\"\n\nHer mother Tanya, described the last time she spoke to her daughter over the phone.\n\n\"Nad called me to say that she was going to die within a minute, maybe two, and that I had to say goodbye to her,\" she said.\n\n\"He said to me: 'This is the only chance, you have to say goodbye'.\n\n\"The grief began immediately after I spoke to her and then I actually collapsed.\n\n\"I was aware there were a lot of people around me so I couldn't scream or howl.\n\n\"I just literally fell. I was engulfed by grief. I lost the ability to stand or even to get up again.\"\n\nAt the inquest, the court heard Pret did not label \"artisan\" baguettes as containing sesame seeds, despite there being six allergic reaction cases in the year before Natasha died.\n\nHer family are now campaigning for a change in food labelling laws, which they described as having \"played Russian roulette\" with their daughter's life.\n\n\"Things need to change now,\" Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said.\n\n\"In my eyes, tomorrow is not soon enough. It's not difficult to label products with allergens.\n\n\"Nobody else should ever have to suffer such a needless death.\"\n\nIn response, Pret chief executive Clive Schlee, said: \"We cannot begin to comprehend the pain the family have felt, and the grief they will continue to feel.\n\n\"We've listened to everything the coroner and Natasha's family have said this week and we will learn from it.\"",

Mr Hammond agrees.\n\nBut he has rejected chances of regular interviews or public platforms to make his case. Why?\n\nTo understand that you have to go back to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland last January.\n\nIn front of an audience of British business leaders, the Chancellor spoke of wanting \"very modest\" changes for business once the UK had left the EU. He thought the comments relatively obvious and anodyne.\n\nThey blew up into a row that kept the newspapers in headlines for two days as pro-Brexit Conservatives attacked him for arguing for the softest of soft Brexits - and Mr Hammond decided that the mute button would henceforth be his political weapon of choice.\n\nOn Monday the Chancellor speaks at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham.\n\nGiven that each appearance is punctuated by long periods under the waves, those close to Mr Hammond know that each \"surfacing\" is closely watched.\n\nHis speeches are not just economic; they are political. And the politics of his speech are all to do with the former foreign secretary and his reported use of an expletive, when asked about business objections to Brexit.\n\nBoris Johnson appears to have been particularly riled by the CBI, the business lobbying group.\n\nHis sentiments were backed on Sunday by Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister, who said the CBI was \"a grave menace to the political stability and economic prospects of the UK\".\n\nMr Baker said the CBI had undue political influence, particularly over relationships with the EU, which brought this tart response from its director-general.\n\n\"CBI represents 190k businesses and has had record numbers joining since ref [referendum],\" Carolyn Fairbairn tweeted. \"We speak for a wider range of firms than anyone else. Shooting messengers gets country nowhere.\"\n\nMr Hammond wants to make it clear he has far more sympathy with Ms Fairbairn than he does with Mr Baker or Mr Johnson.\n\nHe will say business must be at the heart of Conservative party policy. Without their support, Brexit will be all the more difficult, he believes.\n\nThe Chancellor knows he has a difficult hand, with an economy that many of the statistics show has suffered since the referendum.\n\nA multi-billion pound promise of more money for the NHS which has brought forth requests for more funding from other government departments that run the police and the armed forces.\n\nThey are requests Mr Hammond would like to resist while the nation's debts still stand at \u00a31.8trn, or more than 80% of our national income.\n\nAnd Brexit, which the Treasury feels has very little economic upside.\n\nHe will have to nod to all these issues in his speech.\n\nBut it is clear that he wants one message to be heard. If it is not relentlessly pro-businesses, the Conservative party will only add to its problems.\n\nThe last thing it needs is a war with companies that deploy billions of pounds of investment in Britain and around the world.",

He said he was guilty of the lesser offence of manslaughter due to depression.\n\nProsecutors said Billingham had \"turned his anger\" on Mylee to spite Miss Taundry after she began a relationship with a woman.\n\u2022 Latest news and updates from the West Midlands\n\nThe trial had heard how Billingham, who had six children with three women, produced a knife when his ex-partner arrived at his home in Brownhills to pick up their daughter.\n\nMiss Taundry told the court she heard the \"tink\" of the knife as she waited for Mylee to get a bag from inside.\n\nHe told Miss Taundry \"I'm going to kill you\" before dragging Mylee back inside as she screamed \"mummy, mummy\" and \"please daddy, no daddy, stop it\", prosecutors said.\n\nCCTV footage of Billingham and Mylee visiting a local shop just hours before the stabbing was shown in court.\n\nShortly afterwards, he posted a picture on Facebook of his daughter smiling.\n\nAt 21:14 police responded to a 999 call of Billingham wielding a knife, moments after Miss Taundry arrived at the bungalow.\n\nAt the start of the trial, prosecutor Karim Khalil QC said of the killing: \"It was swift, deliberate, clinical, brutal.\n\n\"It was not some manic, unfocused assault.\n\n\"This was no accident and it was not a slight injury. It was a deep, violent thrust of a lethal weapon into the most vulnerable part of his young daughter's body.\"\n\nBillingham - who stabbed himself in the stomach at the scene - ignored police requests for information about what had happened to Mylee as she lay injured on the floor.\n\nHe had told officers he was a \"brilliant\" dad, but was assessed by forensic psychiatrist Philip Joseph who found him to be controlling and prone to violence.\n\nMr Joseph told jurors: \"He has a particular difficulty in coping with the end of relationships and is likely to behave in an aggressive and intimidating manner.\"\n\nBillingham was convicted of causing actual bodily harm in 1990 for an attack on his then girlfriend.\n\nHe was cautioned in 2007 after Mylee's mother alleged he slapped her in the face.\n\nIn accounts of his behaviour by two former partners, one woman claimed she had returned home to find Billingham hiding under her bed with a knife.\n\nThe woman alleged he then sat on a balcony holding their son and asked: \"Haven't you forgotten something?\"\n\nAfter the verdicts, Judge Paul Farrer QC said Billingham underwent an operation part-way through the trial after injuring his wrists while on remand.\n\nHe missed three days of his trial due to a stay in hospital after the apparent attempt to end his life on 21 September.\n\nThe jury had been told to ignore bandages covering Billingham's lower arms when he appeared in the dock.\n\nAfter the trial, Det Insp Jim Colclough, of West Midlands Police, said of the killing: \"It's the most selfish act you can think of. It is the greatest breach of trust you can imagine.\n\n\"Mylee had every reason to believe that Billingham was the most trusted person in the world.\"\n\nHe described the 999 call as a \"terrible thing to listen to\".\n\n\"Officers were in the address for tens of minutes working on Mylee and at that time Tracey was unaware as to how serious the events were that had unfolded inside that address.\"\n\n\"She will never heal from this situation. Mylee will always be missing. She will always be missing a daughter and Mylee's sisters will always be missing a sister.\"\n\nBillingham will be sentenced on Tuesday.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Ryanair has warned investors its full-year profits will be lower than expected, partly due to the recent wave of industrial action.\n\nThe airline said its profits would be 12% lower than the \u20ac1.25-1.35bn (\u00a31.11-1.2bn) previously forecast, and it now expects profits of between \u20ac1.1-1.2bn.\n\nRyanair said this was due to higher oil prices, higher costs associated with EU flight compensation rules, and weaker fares due to the recent strikes.\n\nIt warned it may lower forecasts again.\n\nShares in the airline opened down 8%.\n\nLast week, cabin crew and pilots in Germany, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Portugal took industrial action which led to a number of flight cancellations.\n\nRyanair said fares for the third quarter of the year were lower as forward bookings, particularly for the October school mid-terms and Christmas, were being affected by fear of further strikes.\n\nThe carrier said it had not hedged its fuel bill against prices rises, and this meant it would be paying 10% more for its fuel thanks to the recent rise in the global price.\n\nRyanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said: \"While we successfully managed five strikes by 25% of our Irish pilots this summer, two recent co-ordinated strikes by cabin crew and pilots across five EU countries has affected passenger numbers (through flight cancellations).\n\n\"Customer confidence, forward bookings and [third quarter] fares have been affected, most notably over the October school mid-terms and Christmas, in those five countries where unnecessary strikes have been repeated.\"\n\nThe airline is making cuts to some routes and closing some of its bases.\n\nIts four-aircraft Eindhoven base in the Netherlands will close, although most routes to and from Eindhoven will continue on overseas-based aircraft. It is taking the same action at its two-aircraft Bremen base in Germany and is making cuts at its Niederrhein base.\n\nRyanair says all affected customers have been contacted by email or text message, and will be re-accommodated on other flights or refunded as they wish.\n\nAfter many years of ignoring workers' attempts to get it to recognise unions, Ryanair finally agreed at the end of 2017.\n\nBut staff in a range of countries have continued to have issues with the company's employment practices, in particular its use of contracts based on Irish employment law and its insistence on paying staff through Irish bank accounts, which cause those based elsewhere extra inconvenience and costs.\n\nIn a complex industrial relations background, involving different disputes in different countries with cabin crew and pilots with their own grievances, Ryanair broadly says it is offering staff what they have asked for.\n\nBut staff in certain parts of the company's cross-border operations plainly do not agree, because the possibility of further strike action remains.\n\nRyanair said in its statement it \"cannot rule out further disruptions in [the third quarter], which may require full-year guidance to be lowered further and may necessitate further trimming of loss-making winter capacity\".\n\nDavid Madden, an analysts at CMC Markets, said it was plain Ryanair's aggressive stance was having a negative impact on its business: \"In August 2017 the airline's share price hit an all-time high as the company made a concerted effort to improve customer service prior to that, and it clearly paid off.\"\n\nHe pointed out that since then, the shares had lost 38%\n\n\"Clients like cheap airfares, but they value flight certainty more, and the company is running the risk of doing long-term damage to the brand. The airline is still aiming to make over \u20ac1bn profit, so it's not like they can't afford to pay their staff well.\"",

            "section": "Technology",
            "content": "One of China's most popular video games is testing the use of facial recognition to check users' ages.\n\nHonour of Kings' publisher Tencent announced the move at the weekend.\n\nIt said the trial would initially be limited to \"thousands\" of new players based in Beijing and Shenzhen.\n\nThe title has been criticised in local media over claims children have become addicted to it. But one expert questioned whether the test could be scaled up.\n\nThe mobile app resembles League of Legends and pits players against each other in multiplayer online battles set in a fantasy world.\n\nUnder pressure from local regulators, Tencent introduced restrictions in July 2017 to limit under-12s to one hour of gameplay a day and 13- to 18-year-olds to a maximum of two hours.\n\nLast month, the company added a real-name registration system to encourage players to keep to the rules.\n\nThe facial-recognition test appears to be a further effort to discourage young players from trying to circumvent the time limits.\n\nTencent said a random selection of new players would be assigned to the test when they first signed into the game.\n\nBut it has not disclosed the technology it will use to carry out the scans or how it intends to cross-reference the resulting IDs.\n\nTencent highlighted that many users had previously voiced concerns about the idea of it using facial ID checks in games and said it would evaluate the results of the real-world trial \"in depth\".\n\nThe Chinese state is currently engaged in a wider campaign to control video gaming.\n\nIn addition to concerns over addiction, there have been warnings the activity could be linked to rising levels of near-sightedness.\n\nIn August, the ministry of education announced plans to develop its own age-restriction system and to limit the number of online games available.\n\nBut one expert questioned whether the latest move would be a success.\n\n\"This test is an extension of Tencent's existing Youth Guardian platform, which allows parents to monitor gameplay time and uses facial recognition, but this goes a step further by comparing user images with government photo records,\" said Piers Harding-Rolls, from the IHS consultancy.\n\n\"It is inevitable that this sort of technology will hold some limitations especially for younger children that go through a lot of facial changes as they grow.\n\n\"However, facial recognition technology is improving all the time.\"",
